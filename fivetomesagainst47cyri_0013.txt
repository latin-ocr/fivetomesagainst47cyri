PREFAGE.

ΟΝ the death of Theophilus, Archbishop of Alex-
andria, in A.D. 412, his nephew and successor, S.
cyril, comes suddenly before us. For of S. Cyril's
previous life we have only a few scattered notices.
We do not know in what year he was born, nor any
thing of his parents, nor where he was brought up.
That S. Cyril had received a thoroughly good educa-
tion, is abundantly clear ; not only from his very ex-
tensive reading, which a mind of such large grasp
as S. Oyril’s would ever provide for itself, but that
his reading being so well digested implies good
early training. The great accuracy of his Theo-
logy implies a most accurate Theological education.
That education included a large range of secular
study as well as of Divinity‚ and probably com-
prised a· good deal of learning by heart, not only
of the holy Scriptures but also of profane authors,
as witness a line of Antipater Sidonius quoted in
his Commentary on Zechariah. He quotes too
J osephus on the Jewish war. On Hab. iii. 2, he
mentions interpretations of that verse of two dif-
ferent kinds: on Hosea he gives a long extract
from a writer whom we do not apparently possess.
Tillemont remarks, that “ahis books against Ju-
lian shew that he had a large acquaintance with
secular writers.''
