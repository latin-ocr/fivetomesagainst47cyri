viii PREFAGE.

We may infer that S. Gyril was brought up at
some monastery, as a place 01 Christian eduoation,
and from the great reverenoe which he ever pais]
to S. Isidore, Abbot 01 Pelusium, it seems not un-
likely that S.Isidore was his instructor during
some part 01 1110 early 1110. S, Isidore alludes to
some especial tie, in one 01 his brief letters to
S. Cyril, when Arohbishop. Near the beginning,
S. Isidore says, ‘⁶ 1Ἱ1 I be your father as you say
I be ...... or 11 Ι be your son as I know I am,
seeing that you hold the 011011Ί 01 S. Mark &o.”
The large number 01 Platonio words in S. Isidore’s
letters seem to indicate that he too had extensive
reading 01 Plato, and S. Cyri] may have aoquired
from him some 01 1110 knowledge 01 Aristotle.

But a mind 01 S. Cyril's grasp would 1001 1130011
10013 in the desert, yearning for its own calling, and
another Letter ⁰of the same S. Isidore to S. Cyril,
reproaohing him with his heart being in the world,
may belong to this period. His unole Arohbishop
Theophilus had him to live with him and, we m-ay
infer, ordained him priest and made him one 01 his
Olergy. In a very long letter whioh S. Cyril wrote
about AD. 432 to the aged Aoaoius, Bishop 01
Beroea, he incidentally mentions the fact that he
was at the synod 01 the Oak, in AD. 403, where
S. Chrysostom’s troubles began. S. Cyril would
01 course be there, as a portion 01 Arohbishop
Theophilus' offioial attendanee. S. Cyril says,
‘,‘ dWhen your holy Synod was gathered at great
Constantinople . . . . and I was one 01 those stand-

ing by, I know that I heard your holiness saying
thus—’⁷
