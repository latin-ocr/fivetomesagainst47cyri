PREFACE. 111

S. Oyril's accession to the Archiepiscopal Throne
01 Alexandria brought him at once into a position
01 great power in Alexandria3 and brought too, in
the early part 01 11, trials in regard 01 the disunion
between him and Orestes the Governor resulting
from the Jewish insurrection against the Christians.
To this succeeded some years 01 great quiet, during
which S. Cyril seems to have been very little heard

S. Cyril’s letters were evidently intended priinarily
for his own Egypt ⁰. Thus in his seventh Pascha]
homily ΑΙ). 419, 116 speaks very strongly about
deeds 01 violence in Egypt and mentions the famine
there. S. Cyril introduces the subject with, “fAnd
these things we now say 10 you most especially,
who inhabit Egyptian territory,'' shewing that the
Letters themselves had a larger scope. I do not
know at what time the Letter was sent out, 60 66

stantinople and Antioch in good time to announce
when Lent would begin. But although S. Cyri]
became Archbishop in October ΑΒ. 412, his first
Letter was 101· 414, 111 the early part 01 which (as
Tillemont points out) S. Cyril speaks 01 having
succeeded his Uncle. He introduces the subject
by mentioning the natural dread 01 those 01 old, 01
