X PREFAOE.

“gthe greatness of the Divine Ministry,’' and speak-
ing of Moses and Jeremiah as instances of this,
adds, that ‘⁶ since the garb of the priesthood calls
to preach, in sear of the wordS, Specdc aad hold not
thy peace, I come of necessity to write thus.”
Much of these quiet years S. Cyri] probably em-
ployed on his earlier writings : of these, two were
on select passages of the Pentateuch3 one volume
being allotted to those which S. Cyril thought could
in any way be adapted as types of our Lord, the
other to the rest, as being types of the church. The
commentaries on Isaiah and the'Minor Prophets
and the Books against the Emperor Julian probably
belong to this period. Besides these S. Cyril, fol-
lowing the example of his great predecessor S. Atha-
nasius, wrote two Books against the Arians: first,
the Thesaurus, in which S. Cyri] brought to bear
his knowledge of Aristotle3 then the de Trinitate,
which was written, though not published till later,
before ΑΒ. 424. In his Paschal homily for that
year AD. 4242, S. Cyril also speaks of the Eternal
Generation of the SON, and towards the close of

the homily¹¹ he opposes the Arian terms ‘⁶ Generate,⁷’
⁶ ‘ Ingenerate.''

A. D. 429, the circulation of tracts of Nestorius
in Egypt occasioned him first to write on the he-
resy of Nestorius. There can be little doubt that
the powerful mind of S. Leo, who was the soul of
the Council of Chalcedon, was, in his young days
when S. Celestine's Archdeacon in 429, taught
through those writings3 as S. Cyril himself had
been taught by the writings of S. Athanasius.
