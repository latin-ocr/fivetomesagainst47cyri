PREFAOE. XV

twists S. Cyril’s words so as to mean ‘mixture‚’ and
so replies ⁰. Theodoret seems never to have got
over his misapprehension. For· in his long Let-
1381·Ρ to the Monks of his Province, Euphratesia,
Osroene, Syria, Phoenicia, Cilicia, he still speaks·
of Chapter 1 as teaching that God the Word was
changed into flesh ; of Chapters 2 and 3 as bring-

Union, “teaching through these names a mixture

world has taken the disease3 a letter of sympathy with Nesto-
rius after the reunion of the Easterns with S. Cyril, declaring that,
if his two hands were eut off, he would 118181 agree to what had
been done against Nestorius, (which however he did when re-
quired by the Bishops at Chalcedon) ; a letter to John of Antioch
still condemning the Anathematisms‚ although accepting the
subsequent explanation. Apart from the ‘ atrocious letter’ full of
conceits which it is inconceivable how any one could have written,
Mercator, a contemporary, says it was one of the charges against
Archbishop Doumus, that he had been present when Theodoret
preached a sermon, exulting in the peace which would ensue from
S. Cyril's death. ‘No one now compels to blaspheme. Where
are they who say, that He Who was erucified is God ⁶? ’ Mercator

⁰ There is extant a very careful letter of Theodoret on the In-
carnation, written to Eusebius scholasticus, in which Theodoret
sayS, “ N evertheless we do not deny the properties of the N atures,
but as we deem those ungodly who divide into Two sons the One
Lord J esus Christ, so do we call them enemies of the Truth who
attempt to confuse the natures ς for we believe that an union with-
out confusion has taken place and we know what are the proper-
ties of the human nature, what of the Godhead.’' Then after
mentioning the two natures of a man which do not part him into
τῆνο, “thus do we know that our Lord and God, I mean the Son
of God the Lord Christ, is One Son after His Incarnation too 3 for

the Union is inseverable even as without confusion.” Ep. 21. .
