and confusion of the Divine Nature and the bond-
man’s form: this is the offspring 01 Apollinarius'

Chapter 4, he sums up, “These are the Egyp-
tian' 8 brood, the truly more wicked descendants 01

01 Germanicia, written 61161 15116 Robbers' 00110011
in 449, Theodoret says 01 11, “ Let them deny now
