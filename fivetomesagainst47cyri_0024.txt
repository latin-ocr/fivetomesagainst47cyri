S. Cyril’s anathematisms have been weighed by
Petavius with his usual solidity‚ as compared with
the counter-anathematisms 01 Nestorius, the criti-
cisms 01 the Orientale and 01 Theodoret, and
S. Cyril’s answers. His summary is, ‘There is

who detract from or oppose them maintain their
ground against him except through cavils and
foolish calumnies.’ De Incarn. L. vi. 0. xvii. They

its great spread as Eutychianism, seems to have
chiefly troubled Asia rather than Egypt, S. Cyri]
