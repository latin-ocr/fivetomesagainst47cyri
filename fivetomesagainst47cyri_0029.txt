the Prophets, not the same as was celebrated 011 1110
Apostles, nor yet the same as takes place in regard
to the Angels who are strengthened unto the Divine
MysterieS. For the Lord Christ is Lord of all, as to the
body 100. Αο therefore we say that God is the Creator
of all things, yet does the Scripture call Moses too god,
for it says, I have made thee a qod to Plzaroah, and yet
we by no means attach equal honour to that word, so
neither, because the word is common by which we say,
Christ and Son, ought we 10 stumble at the likeness of

of men what precedes these words: i.e.‚ ‘ gWe call 1110

g The passage occurs, just as Nestorius accused S. Cyril of garb-
lingit, in Book ii. g 4 p. 54. We do not possess the complete
sermon from which this extract is taken: we do possess in Mer-
cator's translation‘four sermons on the subject of the lncarnation,
from the second of which S. Cyril has several extracts In the
case of this sermon the context leaves no doubt that Nestorius
spoke of our Lord's manhood as 0 separate man, whom our Lord
had indefinitely connected with Himself. This long extract of
Nestorius has been given in full as matter of candour. The thing
itself we have not the means of explaining. Although he makes
S. Cyril's extracts from his writings the cause of S. Celestine's
