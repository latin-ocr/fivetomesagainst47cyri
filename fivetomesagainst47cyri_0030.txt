xxiv PREFAOE.

Creator of all God, yet does the Scripture also eall
Moses god z, and, ‘ Israel is called God’ s son, Son too is
the Lord called ;’ and, ‘ Saul is called christ and David
christ yea and the Babylonian5 thus then do we call
Christ the Lorcl also christ.' He therefore thus pieeing
these things and ehipping them off from the rest (as we
said), made up here by his slander like as if from
Paul's words by which he contests writing‚ If με be
circmncz'sed Christ shall profit you notlvivy, one were to
rend off what he says first, If ye be circumcised, and ao-
euse Paul as though he preached, Christ shall profit you,

belief that his teaehing was heretieal. S. Celestine‚ in his letter
to himself, says expressiy, that his conviction came from his own
letters.

“In your letters you have given sentence not so much in re-
spect of our Faith as of your own sels, ehoosing to speak of
God the Word differently from what is the Faith of all.'' Ep.
Celestin. ad Nestorium, Cone. Eph. 1. n. 18.

Again to the Olergy and people of Constantinople S. Celestine
sa s,
ἶ( he preaehes things not to be uttered, persuades things whieh
ought to be shunned, as both his writings sent us by himself

with his own signature, and also the memorial of my holy
brother and oo-Bishop Cyril” &Q Ib. n. 19.

and again writing to John Arehbishop of Antioeh S. Celestine

says,
“he pours into the people most devoted to Christ certain per-
verse things against the revel-enee of the virgin-birth and. the
hope of our salvation. These things have come to us from the
sorrow of the faithfu13 these things have been published in the
books himself sent, and stronger proof yet, these things have
been so eonveyed to us in letters fortified with the very sig-

nature of their author, that one may not any longer doubt.”
Ib. n. 20.

Helladius bishop of Tarsus and Eutherius Bishop of Tyana in
their memorial to S. Sixtus, against S. cyril, the Couneil of
Ephesus, and the reconciliation thereto of John Arehbishop of
Antioeh‚ mention this “ garbled extract,” Synodicon e. 117.
