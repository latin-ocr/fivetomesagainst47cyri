memory, on the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity,
in which he had interwoven some things on the In-
carnation, like what 116 116(1 now written.

We do not know what time intervened between
this and the second Letter which S. Cyril wrote in
Synod to Nestorius, containing an exposition 01
13116 Incarnation‚ which, from its accepta-nce by the
Council 01 Ephesus and the whole Church subse-
quently, has Ecumenical authoritym. It was pro-
bably written before the close 01 A.D. 429 and is
13116 Letter quoted above ¹¹, which Nestorius' reply

· shewed that he could not understand. It has been

supposed that it was in consequence 01 Nestorius'
allusion 130 the Imperial Oourt in the close 01 1116
reply, that S. Cyril wrote his Three Treatises de
recta fide; 111161601 the first is to the Emperor
Theodosius3 the other two to the Emperor's Queen
and Sisters. John Bisliop 01 Caesarea in Pales-
tine, in the century following S. Cyril, quotes from
both among his extracts in defence 01 the Council
01 Chalcedon 0. From the title with which he 111-
troduces his extracts, we learn 1311613 the longer
Treatise was addressed to the Emperor’s two
younger sisters, the Prinoesses Marina and Arca-
dia, and the 16613 01 the Three to the Two Augus-
ta's, Theodosius’ Empress Eudocia, and his eldest
sister Pulcheria who had the title 01 Augusta, from
having been Regent 101 the Emperor in his mino-
rity. S. Cyril afterwards recast his Treatise to
the Emperor in the form 01 6 Dialogue, omitting
what was specially addressed to the Emperor, and
giving little touches here and there to the language.
