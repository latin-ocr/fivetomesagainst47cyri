reached some degree 01 intimacy with him3 he
wrote too to Donatus, Bishop 01 Nicopolis, on the
west 01 010000, and no doubt there were other
friendships too as the fruit 01 the long sojourn at
Ephesus. Some 01 S. Cyril’s letters shew how

close of 1311011 life in the Capita] of the Ephesians 3 ''

completed and the Bishops dismissed, S. Cyril
wrote to John Archbishop 01 Α11110011. John, in
his Relatio 10 1110 Emperors, says,
