PREFAOE. xxxi

its members, determined to assemble the next day.
Nestorius’ friends headed by Tranquillinus‚ Bishop
01 Antioch in Pisidia, got up a memorial to the
Council that they should Wait for John 01 Α11-
tioch, “who is himself now at the door, as he has
intimated by his Letters,'’ and for some Wes-
tern Bishops. The document further speaks 01
the unlawfulness 01 excommunicated or deposed
Bishops being admitted into the Council and ends
With the threatening words f,

“And let your Reverence know, that all that shall 106
done in an abrupt way by daring men will be turned

back against the daring 01 them who so presume, both
by Christ the Lord and by the Divine Canons.''

There follow 68 signatures, 16 01 the Province
01 Antioch including the two nery-arrived Alex-
anders (an indication that they, while they deli-
vered John's message, did not consider it as pre-
cluding four days' delay) about 30 other friends
01 Nestorius. They procured also about 23 other
signatures. These 23 however joined the Council
next· day as a matter 01 course, and signed the
deposition 01 Nestorius. Among the signatures is
that 01 Euprepius Bishop 01 Byza who signs for
himself and for his Nestorian Metropolitan Fritilas
01 Heraclea. But Euprepius did not remain with
his Metropolitan. I do not see his name on the
entry-roll 01 the Council at its opening session ; but
he signs the deposition of Nestorius. His name is
among the last signatures‚ as though he had come
in late.

No deliberative body whatever would accept such
