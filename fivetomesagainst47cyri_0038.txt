xxxii PREFACE.

an insulting memorial as this of the friends of Nes-
torius, and of course it does not appear in the Acts
of the Council. Gount Irenaeus, the friend of Nes-
torius, afterwards Bishop of Tyre, has preserved
it to us with other curicus documents of his party.
Christian Lupus at the end of the 17ffl1 century
transcribed the greater part of an unique manu-
script in the Monastery Library of Monte Cassino g.
The compiler is thought to be an African3 he was
a contemporary of Facundus, Bishop of Hermaeum,
and just as Facundus wrote very eagerly in behalf
of Theodore of Mopsuestia, this compiler wrote
very strongly in defence of Theodoret. His prin-
cipal material was a curious and extensive collec-
tion of documents and Letters made by Count
Irenaeus, Bishop of Tyre, after the Council of
Ephesus 3 it contains Letters that passed between
the different Bishops in the Province of Antioch
about Nestorius and S. Cyril, and their Views as
to reconciliation with S. Gyrss, and one sees how
eagerly the principa] Bishops got hold of a copy of
any fresh letter which S. Cyril wrote. This col-
lection alone preserves S. Cyril's great Letter to
Aeacius Bishop of Beroea, 111 reply to the first de-
mand 01 the Eastern Bishops that the N icene Creed
was enough and that S. Cyril should burn all else
which he had written on dogma. S. Cyril alludes
to this Letter of his in his letter to his Proctors at
Constantinople '² and a fragment of it is preserved

8 It forms Vol. 7 of his collected works, also published by
Stophen Baba, is incorporated into Subsequent editions of the
Concilia, and again with some additions and corrections, after a
fresh inspection of the manuscript by Mansi.
