PREFACE. xxxiii

by John Archbishop of Caesarea in Palestine in his
Thesaurus of extracts of S. Cyril in Defence of the
Council of Chalcedon, and two or three fragments
of it by J ohn's opponent, Severus of Antioch, both
ybelonging to the earlier half of the sixth century.
ἒ Irenaeus being a contemporary of the Council of
i Ephesus, all the letters and documents collected by
him seem to have been accepted without any doubt
as to their genuineness. We also possess several
from other sources. But the Compiler, who made
use of Oount Irenaeus' collection, has also inserted
towards the end of his compilation, some docu-
ments from other MSS. to which he had access:
one of these is absolutely worthless, viz. a confes-
sion οῗ faith, purporting to be that of Acacius
Bishop of Beroea, but evidently of later date.
Α Irenaeus' compilation is called a Tragedyi. Re-
naudot, in his history, has pointed out that Ebed-
jesu of Soba, who lived in the end of the l2th cen-
tury, has mentioned the work in his catalogue of
Ecclesiastical writers ¹³. Ebedjesu says ¹, ‘⁶ Irenaeus
of Tyre compiled five Ecclesiastica on the perse-
cution of Nestorius and all that happened at that
timem.” Two or three pages beforeu, Ebedjesu, in
his catalogue of Nestorius’ writings, gives also, “A
Book of a Tragedy.'’

The little treatise or rather Confession of S. Atha-
nasius from which S. Cyril cites in his Book against
Theodore⁰ is put by Montfaucon, S. Athanasius’
Editor, among the dubia. Montfaucon’s grounds

¹ See the Compiler’s words at the end of cap. 94, “are put in
order by Irenaeus in what is called his Tragedy.’'
