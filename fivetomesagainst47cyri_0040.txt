xxxiv PREFAOE.

for doing so are twofold; 1, that the very famous
expression, One summme Nature of the Worcz P,
seems to contradict what S. Athanasius says in
other writings3 2, that the treatise was objected
to by Leontius of Byzantium, at the beginning of
the seventh Century.

Of the first ground of doubt, no one but a stu-
dent of S. Athanasius has any right to speak. The
second dwindles to nothing.

Leontius sayS,

“They [the party of Severus, the great Monophysite
Bishop of Antiooh] put forward another passage as S.
Athanasius', from his treatise on the Inearnation. It is
on this wise, ‘ And that the Same is Son of God after the
Spirit, Son of man after the fiesh, not that the one
Son is two natureS, the one to be worshipped, the other
not to be worshipped, but One Nature Incarnate of God
the Word.’ To this we say, that first it in no wise op-
poses us, for neither do we hold two natures, one to be ,
worshipped, the other not, but we hold One Nature In· Ι·
carnate of Grod the Word. N ext it is not S. Athanasius'.
For when they are asked by us, where it is, and cannot
easily shew it, in their perplexity they put forvvard
some small treatise, about two leaves, in which this
passage is: but it is evident to all, that all S. Athana-
sius' writings are very large. ἵ

“ But what can we say, when they put forward blessed ,
Gyril, citing this against Theodore, as being S. Athana-
sius?' To this we say, that it does indeed lie in the bles-
sed Cyril’s utterings against Theodore, yet it is an old
error. For Dioscorus succeeding blessed Cyril, and
finding his works, would perchanee not have minded

P See on this Formula Card. Newman’s exhaustive treatise,
‘ On S. Cyril's formula of the μία φύσις] Traots Theologioal and
Ecelesiastieal, 18743 who however says ‘whether S. Athanasius
himself used it, is a contested point.' p. 335.
