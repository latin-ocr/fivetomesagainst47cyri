PREFAOE. XXXV

adding what he pleased : we might even conjecture that
the blessed Cyril did not cite it against Theodore3 and
that it is so, is clear from this. For Theodoret speaking
in behalf of Theodoro, overturning all the passages which
blessed Cyril cited. against him from the 110157 Fathers‚
has no where mentioned this. To this they say that
Theodoret passed it over craftily: for not able to answer
it as patent, he of purpose passed it by. To this we

“perhaps Dioscorus added something.”

This confession was very well known by S. Cyri] 3 -
for besides citing it here, he cites (as Montfaucon
observes) almost the whole of. it in the beginning 01
1115 Treatise de recta Fide to the Princesses Arcadia
and Marina, to sheW that S. Athanasius used the
term, Mother 01 God3 S. Cyri] also cited two pieces
