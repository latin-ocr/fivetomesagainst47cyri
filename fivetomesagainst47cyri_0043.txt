PREFAOE. xxxvii

THE special form of ’[116 disease, to which the
name of Nestorius became attached, was hereditary
in the great Provinee of Antiooh. It is the sadder‚
because it came to him, lurking in the writings of
men of even great name, oommentators on large

Episcopate, written against other hereties, Arians‚
EunomianS‚ Origen, Apollinarius‚ and was intimate
with S. Chrysostom and with S. Gregory of Na-
zianzus. The way of truth as well as the way of
life is narrow.

Diodore of Γ1161151151, ‘by whose books,' he sayS,
