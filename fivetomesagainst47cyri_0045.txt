that ‘ Mary bare Grod ' not ‘ the Godhead.'] Paul, ‘ For
he was not before ages.’ Nestorius,—-‘ And he assigns
a tempora] Mother to the Godhead, the Creator of times.’
Paul, ‘ Mary received the Word and is not older than the
WVord? ‘Nestorius, ‘How then did Mary bear Him
Who is older than herself ?' Paul, ‘Mary bore a man
like unto us,² NestoriuS, ‘He tho was born of the
Virginis man.’ PauL—‘but a man in all things su-
perior, since He is from the Holy Ghost, and from the
promises, and from the Soripture is the grace upon
Him.’ Nestorius said, ‘It saith, “I saw the Spirit de-
scending like a dove upon Him and abiding on Him‚”
which bestowed upon Him the Ascension. “ Command-
ing, it saith, the Apostles whom He had chosen He was
taken up through the Holy Ghost.'' This then it was,
which conferred on Christ such glory.' Paul said, ‘that
neither He Wsho is of David having been anointed be
alien from Wisdom, nor that Wisdom should dwell in
any other in like way, for it was in the Prophets and
yet more in Moses and in many Saints‚ and yet more in
Christ as in the Temple of God.' And elsewhere he
says, that ‘other is Jesus Christ and other the Word.'
Nestorius said, ‘ That it was not possible that He Who
was born before all ages should anew be born, and that,
according to the Godhead.’ See, the transgressor is
made manifest, saying, that He Who was begotten of
the Father was not born of Mary. See, he agrees with
the heretic Paul of Samosata who says that ‘Other is
the Word and other J esus Christ ³ and is not one, as the
right Faith teaches.
