happy Nestorius, suddenly changed from a sheep to a
wolf, began to rend the flock of Christ, when they too
who were torn, in great part still believed him to be a
sheep, and so the more easily fell into his jaws l ’

Theodoret ¹¹, who had for so many years defended
him, after he had once condemned him at Chalce-
don, spoke more severely of him than any other
writer. Theodoret was of an affectionate disposi-
tion. The great bane of his life waS, that he would
believe any evil of S. Cyril, rather than suspect
his former friend Nestorius to be in the wrong.
Under this prejudice, he believed S. Cyri] to be an
Apollinarian which he was not, rather than suspect
Nestorius to be the heretic which he was. When
then S. Leo espoused his cause against the worth-
less successor of S. Oyril, Dioscorus, and shewed
at once how the two opposite heresies 01 Eutyches
and Nestorius were equally inconsistent with Ca-
tholic truth, his eyes may have been opened, and
he may have felt towards Nestorius as the occasion
to him of an almost lifelong error, from which 116
was rescued by his own deposition and disgrace.
Nestorius too had, as far as was known, died

*¹ Haeret. Fab. iv. 12. Leontius (A. D. 610.) quotes this work
in proof how Theodoret held Nestorius in abhorrence, (against
a spurious correspondence between Theodoret and Nestorius in
which they were made to acknowledge each other) de sectis. iv.
5. Photius (cod. 56.) says of this work of Theodoret‚ which he
had read, ‘he goes down to Nestorius and his heresy, pouring
upon him unmingled censure. He goes on also to the Eutychian
heresy‚' (the two last chapters of 1116 ivth. book.) No one attends
now to Garnier’s paradox that the account of Nestorius was sub-
stituted from a younger Theodoret for the original statement of
Themloret, while the account of Eutyches connected with it is to
be from Theodoret himself.
