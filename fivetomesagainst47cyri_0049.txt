PREFACE. xliii

unrepentant in an heresy which denied the Incar-
nation. His later account of Nestorius is,

‘ i From the first, Nestorius shewed what he was going
to be all his life through: that he cultivated a mere
popular eloquence, eliciting empty applause and attract-
ing to himself the unstable multitude3 that he went
about, clad in a mourning garment, walking heavily,
avoiding public throngs, seeking by the pallor of his
looks to appear ascetic‚ at home mostly given to books
and living quietly by himself. He went on to advanced
age enticing the many by such habits and cormterfeits,
seeking to seem to be a Christian rather than to be one,
and preferring his own glory to the glory of Christ?

The course of his heresy Theodoret describes in

Sllmmal'y.

‘ 1 The first step of his innovation was that we must not
confess the Holy Virgin who bare the VVord of God
having taken flesh of her, to be Theotocos‚ but Christo-
tocos only, whereas the heralds of the orthodox saith

long ago (τῶν πάλαι καὶ πρόπαλαι) taught to call her
Theotocos, and believe her the Mother of the Lord.'

Then he mentions the plea of Nestorius,

‘that the name Christ signifies the two Natures, the
Godhead and Manhood of the Only-Begotten, but that
of God absolutely the simple and incorporeal essence of
God the WVord 3 and that of man the human nature alone 3
therefore it is necessary to confess the Virgin to be
Christotocos and not Theotocos‚ lest unawares we say
that God the Word took the beginning of His Being
from the holy Virgin, and so should be obliged consist-
ently to confess that the Mother was older than He Who
was born of her?

Lastly he mentions the preaching of Nestorius,

i Haeret. Fab. iv. 12.
