Lord as a man, an instrument of Deity 3 ’ ⁶ Ι’6 tem-
ple created of the Virgin for God the VVord to in-
habit,’ and having a close or continual or the high-
est connection with God3 but still the ⁶ connection’
was different in degree, not in kind, from that with
any Saint.

The hereditary title of the Mother of the Lord,
which even Theodoret‚ when his strife with S. Cyril
was over, recognised as “lthe Apostolical tradition,’
excluded this humanising of our Lord. And so
Nestorius (a grave historian says r) continuously
teaching hereon in the Church, endeavoured 111 611
ways to expel the term Theotocos, and dreaded the
term as they do hobgoblins S. This 116 did, Socrates
adds, ‘ 01113 of great ignorance.'

‘ Being by nature fluent of speech, he was thought to
have been educated; but in truth, he was ill-trained,
and disdained to learn the books of the ancient interpre-
hers. For being puffed up for his fiuency of speech, he

did not attend accurately to the ancientS, but thought
himself superior to all!

Yet the term Theotocos had been in such fami-
liar use by every 6011001 for nearly two centuries,
that the aversion of Nestorius to it can hardly
have been simple ignorance. It was probably the
instinctive aversion of heresy to the term which
condemns it. Socrates himself mentions that it
was used by Origen and Eusebius: it was used
alike by Alexander, the predecessor of S. Athana-
sius¹³7 whose Council first condemned Arius3 by
