PRE FAOE. xlvii

S. Athanasius himself ¹²3 by the Arian Eusebius Χ;
and by S. Cyril of Jerusalem y, who did not use the
word Homoousion. The Apostate Emperor Julian
said, in controversy with the Christians, ⁶ ² Did
Isaiah say that a Virgin should bear God? but ye
do not cease calling Mary Theotocos,’ attesting
that the word was in the mouths of all Christians. -
A little later it was used by the two S. Gregories ³.
It was used also by the great predecessor of Nesto-
rius in the see of Constantinople, S. Chrysostom,
as also by Ammon Bishop of Adrianople in Egypt,
and by Antiochus Bishop of Ptolemais in Phoe-
nicia ¹³. The corresponding title, Mater Dei, was
used in the Latin Church by S. Ambrose⁰‚ Cas-
sian d, and Vincent of Lerins ⁰.

John of Antioch, at a later period, entreating
Nestorius to accept the term, in order to prevent
the impending schism, said to him,

‘This name no one of the ecclesiastica] teachers has
declined. For those who have used it have been many

and eminent, and those who have not used it have never
imputed any error to those who used it.'
