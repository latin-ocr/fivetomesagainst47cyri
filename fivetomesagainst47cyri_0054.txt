xlviii PREFAOE.

John endeavoured to smoothe to him the adoption
of the word.

‘fThe ten days, which Celestine allowed, are very short,
but it might be made matter of a single day, perhaps
only of a few hours. For to use a convenient word in the
dispensatim] of our Sovereign Ruler Christ for us, which
has been used by many of the fathers, and is true as to
the saving Birth of the Virgin, is easy 3 which thy holi-
ness ought not to decline, nor take that into account,
that one ought not to do things contrary. Foris thy
mind is the same as that of the fathers and teachers of
the Church (for this, my lord, Ι have heard from many
common friends), what grief has it, to utter a pious
thought in a corresponding word ‘?’

Nestorius seems to have thought it to have been
his office to convert the Church to his misbelief.
He says,

‘ g Ι see in our people much reverence and most fervent

piety, but that they are blinded as to the dogma of the

knowledge of God. But this is not the fault of the
people, but (how shall I say it courteously '?) that the

teachers had not opportunity to set before you aught
of the more accurate teaching.'

This was strong language, that the people of
Constantinople were in error as to the saith through
the fault of its former Bishops3 but he also owned
thereby, that his saith was different from theirs.
‘ Art thou tlien,’ Cassian ¹¹ apostrophises him, ‘ the
amender of former Bishops, the condemner of
former Priests‘? art thou more excellent than
Gregory, more approved than Nectarius, surpass-
ing John Ῥ ’
