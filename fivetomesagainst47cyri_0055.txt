PREFACE. xlix

Nestorius seems to have chosen for himself the
office of arbiter between ideal parties. In his
third Epistle to S. Celestine he says,

‘iIt is known to your Blessedness, that if two sects
stand over against one another, and one of them only
uses the word Theotocos, and the other only Anthropo-
10006, and each sect draws the other to its own confession,
so that, if it do not obtain this, there is peril lest it fall
from the Church, it will be necessary, that one deputed
to the consideration of this matter, having care for each
sect, should remedy the peril of either party, by a word
delivered by the Evangelist which signifies both natures.
For that word, ChristotocOS, tempers the assertion of
ἵ 100111, because it both removes the blasphemy of the
Samosatene which is spoken of Christ, the Lord of all, as
’ if He were apure man, and also puts to fiight the malice
of Arius and Apollinarius.’

It is strange that he did not see (if indeed he did
not see what every one else saw), that Christotocos,
as opposed 150 Τ116010006, could only mean ‘mother
of the Messiah,’ 1. 6. 111011161· of Him who should be
the Messiah. Vincent of Lerins uses the homely
illustration‚

‘J' as we speak of the mother of 6 Presbyter or a Bishop,
not that she bare one who was already 6 Presbyter or 6
Bishop, but 6 111611 who was afterwards made a Presbyter
or Bishop.’

S. John Damascene says,

‘ ¹< We do not call the holy Virgin christotocos, because
Nestorius invented it 10 deny the word Theotocos.'

The name ‘Anthropotocos ’ must have been a
fiction of his own, in order to make room for his
