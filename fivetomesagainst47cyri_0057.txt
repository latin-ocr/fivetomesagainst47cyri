PREFACE. 11

‚lover of Nestorius and his Jewish dogmas.’ He
burst out in a sermon openly, ‘ plet no one call
Mary theotocos: for Mary was human3 but it is
impossible that one human should bear God? This
the people could ill-endure. Nestorius supported
it with veheinence.

The other statement which reached S. Cyril, and
which he mentioned to some at Constantinople,
who blamed him for his letter to the monks q, was
by Dorotheus Bishop of Marcianopolis, who said
openly, ‘Anathema, if any call the holy Mary,
Theotocos.'

This went much further than the former. It pro-
nounced Anathema (as S. Cyril saw) upon all who
held what all held and expressed, upon the whole
Catholic Church. Nestorius at once received him
to Communion.

Nestorius supported the denial of the Theotocos
In his first Sermon he says, that he had been asked
whether the Blessed Virgin was to be called ⁶ An-
thropotocos or Theotocos.' He appealed to his

without mother, without descent.' Mary bore not God,
my good friends. For that which is born of the fiesh is
fiesh, and. that which is born of the Spirit 16 spirit.
The creature bare not the Uncreated: the Father did
not beget God the Word. For ‘in the beginning was
13116 Word,' as John saith. The creature did not bear the
Creator, but she bare a Man, the instrument of Deity:
the Holy spirit did not create God the W ord 3 for that
