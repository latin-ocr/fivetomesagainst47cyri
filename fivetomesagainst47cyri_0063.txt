PREFACE. lvii

water covereth the sea, and the Emperors are in exceed-
ing joy, being enlightened as to the doctrine, and, to

speak briefly, one may see daily, as to all the heresies

which fight with God and the orthodoxy of the Church,
that word is daily fulfilled with us, the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker, and the house of David
waxed stronger and stronger.'

It is not much that the Emperor told S. Cyril d,
that the Churches were united and would be yet
more, and that he [S. Cyril] was forgiven3 (for
Nestorius had persuaded him that S. Cyri] was a
mere disturber of the peace) or that Nestorius on
one occasion speaks of the people being thronged θ.
But some were even ready to turn against those
who objected to his teachings, and ‘many Clergy
and laymen from Constantinople coming to Antioch
and Beroea agreed with the saying of Dorotheus, as

having nothing contrary to Apostolic doctrine or
the saith of Nicaea ἕ]

In these three years, S. Cyril had only broken
silence three times ; once in his letter to the monks
in Egypt3 a letter to Nestorius, explaining the oc-
casion of that letter when he heard that Nestorius
was offended by it; and the second full statement
of doctrine in the Epistle, which was received by
the Gouncil of Ephesus.

i. The first was his ‘letter to the Monks of Egypt)
Grave perplexity had been occasioned to some of
them, even as to the Divinity of our Lord, through
some writings attributed to Nestorius. S. Cyril
