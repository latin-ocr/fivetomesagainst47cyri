PREFACE. lix

And when Ι would learn the cause of the grief of thy
Piety, they said that some from Alexandria were circu-
lating the letter written to the holy Monks, and that
this was the occasion of the hatred and displeasure. Ι
wondered then, that thy Piety did not rather think
with Itself, that the disturbance as to the faith did not
originate with my letter, but with some, whether written
by thy Piety or no, but any how papers or exegeses which
were circulated. We then toiled, wishing to restore those
misled. For some would hardly admit that Christ is
God3 but that He was rather an organ or instrument
of the Deity and a God-bearing man, and things even
beyond this. I had then reason to complain of the
things, which thy Piety did or did not write. (For Ι do
not much trust the papers which are carried about.)
How then should Ι be silent, when saith is so injured and
so many are perverted ? Shall we not be placed before
the J udgement-seat of Christ? Shall we not give account
for the unseasonable silence, having been appointed by
Him to say what is meet ⁸? What shall Ι do now ’.Ρ For Ι
must consult with thy Piety. And that, when the most
religious and God-beloved Bishop of the Roman Church,
and the God-beloved Bishops with him, report about
the papers brought thither, Ι know not how, whether
by thy Piety or no. For they write, as exceedingly
scandalized. And how shall we soothe those who come
from the East from all the Churohes, and murmur a-
gainst the papers‘? Or does thy Piety think, that only
a little disturbance has sprung up in the Churches from
such homilies‘? We are all struggling and toiling‚
bringing back those who are somehow mispersuaded to
think otherwise. When then it is thy Piety, who made
all of necessity murmur, how does It justly find fault?
Why does It cry out against me, and that to no purpose,
and does not rather correct Its own speech, to stop this
world-wide scandal‘? For though the speech is past,
yet as being diffused among the people, let it be set
straight by revision, and do thou vouchsafe to concede
