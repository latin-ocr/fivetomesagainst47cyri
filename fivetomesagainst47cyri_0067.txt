would not go along with3 that he [S. Cyril] had
had no part in the circulation 01 111161 116 had writ-
ten in Constantinople3 that he had written the
like many years before, and that this too might
become a fresh subject 01 111011111111611011, 11 11 should
be published‚ whereas from its date 113 could have
no bearing on Nestorius. One only request he
makes him, the same, which John 01 Α11110611 1116
friend 01 Nestorius also made, by acceding to which
he might have escaped his own evil memory and
being the author 01 1116 miserable rent in the body
01 Christ, that 116 would vouchsafe to concede one
word, Theotocos. But it would have been 10 give
up his heresy.

The Presbyter Lampon who took S. Cyril’s let-
ter, could only obtain from Nestorius 1116 following
haughty answer, in which he avoided every topic

01 1116 161161· 01 S. Cyril.

‘kNothing is mightier than Christian equity. We have
111611 been constrained thereby to the present letter
through 13116 111061 religious presbyter Lampon, who said
many things about thy Piety to us, and heard also much,
and at last did not give way to 116, 1111111 116 wrung the let-
ter from us, and we have been conquered by the man's im-
portunity. For I own that I have great awe of all Chris-
tian goodness of every man, as having God residing in
him. We then, although many things have been done
by your Religiousness (to speak mildly) not according
to brotherly love, continue in long-suffering and the
friendly intercourse of letterS. But experience will shew,
what is the fruit of the constraint of the most religious
Presbyter Lampon. I and those with me salute all the
brotherhood together with thee.’
