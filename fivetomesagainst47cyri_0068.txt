lxii PREFACE.

The answer 01 Nestorius was in fact an apology
to himself 101· vouchsafing to write to S. Cyril.

The second Epistle 01 S. Cyri] is also Apologetic,

‘¹in answer to some who are babbling to thy Piety
against my reputation and that incessantly, watching,
above all, the seasons of the meetings of those in power.’

The Epistle is throughout doctrinal. But there

a brother. But if any one seem to be contentious, to
such an one Paul will cry out through us also, We
have no such custom, neither the Church of God.’

It may be that S. Cyril's letters to the Imperial
family may have been occasioned by the statement
which Nestorius gives 01 the joy 01 the Sovereign
on being enlightened as to the dogma. But al-
