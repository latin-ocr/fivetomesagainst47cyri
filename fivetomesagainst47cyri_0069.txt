PREFACE. lxiii

though he states the fact clearly to them, he nei-
ther mentions Nestorius, nor quotes any known
saying of his.

He himself waited. He had learned probably
from his fiery adhesion to his uncle and early bene-
factor, Theophilus, and its injustioe to the memory
of S. Chrysostom. He says to those who reproached
him for his letter to the monks of Egypt, that he
might have returned anathema for anathema,

‘¹¹ Since we who are yet living, and the Bishops through-
out the world, and our fathers who have departed to
⁴ God have been anathematised. For what hindered me
too from writing the converse of 1115 words, ‘ If any
one say not that Mary is Theotocos, be he anathema? ’
But Ι have not done this hitherto for his sake, lest any
should say, that the Bishop of Alexandria, 1. 0. the
Egyptian Synod, has anathematised him. But if the
most religious Bishops in East and West shall learn,
that all have been anathematised, (for all say and con-
fess that the holy Mary is Theotocos) how will they be
disposed‘? How will they not be grieved, if not for
themselves, yet for the holy fathers, in whose writings
we find the holy Virgin Mary named Theotocos? If I
did not think it would be burdensome, I would send
many books of the holy Fathers, in which you may find
not once but many times this word used, whereby they
confess that the holy Virgin Mary is Theotocos.'

When at last he wrote to ask the advice of
S. Celestine0, he says.

‘During the time past Ι have been silent and have
written absolutely nothing concerning him who is now
at Constantinople and rules the Churoh, either to your
Piety or to any other of our fellow-ministers, believing
that precipitancy in these things is not without blame.'
