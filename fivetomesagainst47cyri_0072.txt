the letters delivered, had himself also to deliver
them.’

A synod then was held at Rome, in which, after
many sessions -V, the Bishops declared him to have
devised a new very grievous heresy, and condemned
him.

A fragment of a speech of S. Celestine is pre-
servedZ, in which he cited the authorities of
S. Ambrose in his Veni redemptor gentium, S. Hi-
lary and S. Damasus. S. Celestine announced to

Nestorius the result ;

‘ Unless you teach as to Christ our God the same which
the Church of the Romans and the Alexandrians and
the holy Church in great Constantinople held excellently
well till you, and, within the tenth day counted from
the day of this admonition, annul by an open confession
in writing that faithless novelty which undertakes to
sever what holy Scripture unites, thou art cast out of
all communion with the Catholic Church.’

S. Celestine wrote the same to John of Antioch ².
This judgement he had entrusted to S. Cyril, hold-
ing his place. S. Cyril wrote what had passed and
the condemnation of Nestorius by the Roman Synod
to John of Antioch b, telling him, that the Council
had written the like to ‘ Rufus Bishop of Thessalo-
nica, and other Bishops of Macedonia, who always
‘agree with them,⁷ and to Juvenal Bishop of AElia3
that he himself should follow their decision, and
asking him to consider what to do to hinder this
breach of communion.
