¹ John of Antioch was alarmed at this prospect of
3 rent, and wrote to Nestorius to prevent it by
accepting the word Theotocosss. He wrote not in
1ι is own name only, but in that of six other Bishops
who were then with him, among them Theodoret.
³! e wrote in entire sympathy with Nestorius, in
antagonism to those opposed to him. He speaks
of the many, as ‘unrestrained against us,⁷ and asks,
‘what will they be, now that they have gained
support from these wretched letters ’θ’ Η6 takes it
for granted that the faith of Nestorius was sound;
116 had heard that he had said that he would use
the word [Theotocos] if any of those in high repute
in the Church suggested it, tells him that he does
not exhort him to disreputable change, or, so to
say, ‘ boyish contradiction3' that ‘ though my lord
Celestine had fixed a very narrow time for the
answer, yet one day, perhaps a few hours would
be enough ; and urges him to take the counsel of
those of his own mind, allowing them to speak
fearlessly what was useful, not what was pleasant.’
’ John himself held and stated the true saith, and
hought the word Theotocos the convenient and
true way to express it, and that to reject it would
jeopardise the unspeakable mystery of the Only-
Begotten Son of God.

Nestorius had however taken his line. He an-
swers in apparent amazement3

‚ “lI thought that people could have set anything in
J motion against 1116 rather than the calumny that Ι do
not hold aright as to the piety of saith, I who hitherto
, have been delighted that many thousand hostilities rise
’ against me on account of the battle which I have against
