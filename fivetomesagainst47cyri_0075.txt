difficult enquiry‚ nor be a hindrance to treating of the
Divinity of the Lord Jesus.'

S. Celestine says f,

‘He asks a field for battle, he calls for a sacerdotal
examination, at which he would not be present. Who
would have thought that he who asked for a synod

the circular summons to the Council, of which the
only extant copy is addressed to him. The letter
