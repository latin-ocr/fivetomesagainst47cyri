the rest are related to have arrived later. The
Council was the plan of Nestorius, and he naturally
came among the first, to guide, as he hoped, its
decisions. S. Cyril, on his arrival, found that there
had been active, though ineffectual, efforts against
the saith. He wrote, ‘the Evil one, the sleepless
beast, is going about, plotting against the saith of

Nestorius says, that he had no intercourse with
S. Cyril. He wrote to Scholasticus, an Eunuch of
the Emperor and his friend3 ‘ Cyril has both here-
tofore entirely avoided any converse with us, and

the forgery by use of Mss. sayS‚ it contains nothing ‘quod nobis
adversetur,' i.e. to the Catholic Faith. (de sectis Act. 8.) Τ116
words are, ‘perfectus Deus in carne et perfectus homo in Spiritu.’
Vitalis confessed that ‘ Christ was a perfect man,' but explained
it to mean, ‘We say so far that Christ was a perfect man, that
we ascribe Divinity to Him instead of a mind) S. Epiph. Hoer.
