S. Cyril preached at this time against Nestorius t.
The pure humanitarianism of Nestorius was
elicited by the attempts of Theodotus of Ancyra,
and his pious friend, Aeacius, Bishop of Melitene,
to bring him back to the faith. To Theodotus
and several others, he repeated the well-known

blasphemies about our Lord's sacred Infancy and
Childhood, that he would not call H im God, who
