lxxvi PREFAOE.

Nestorius came to a better mind, he should be 16-
ceived. He had, up to the moment 01 the opening
01 1116 Council, made things worse. He had taken
into his own mouth the blasphemies, which before
he had sanctioned in his adherent, Dorotheus. If
one who nakedly denied the Incarnation was not
fit to be Patriarch 01 Constantinople, Nestorius
had decided against 1111116611. It brought out what
1651111 his letter to S. 051111 which was 10111161151 0011-
demned by the Council, that our Lord’s relation to
God was the same in kind, although not in degree,
as that 01 61151 devout Christian.

There could be no question among any who
listened to the evidence, as there was none among
any 01 those who heard it. He was deposed on
the evidence 01 his own letter to S. 051111, 01 twenty
sayings in his acknowledged works, and 01 contra-
dictions to the 161111 111 Ephesus 116611.

S. Celestine had, it seems, collected a new Synody
at Rome, from which he wrote to the Council. The
001111011 116611 reported that

‘Zalthough the whole multitude 01 Bishops were hin-
dered from coming to Ephesus by the distance, yet
being gathered in those parts, they, Celestine presiding‚
with entire consent, uttered our mind as to the saith.

Those who came, explained to this our Synod by letter
the mind of the whole Western Church.’

Philip, a presbyter, and Roman legate, 61161 read-
ing the Acts, declared that all things had been

adjudged ‘ ³ according to the Canons and Ecclesias-
tical discipline.’
