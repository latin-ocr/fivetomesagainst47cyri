PREFAOE. lxxvii

After long canvass on the part of the deputies
of J ohn's party to obtain a rescinding of the sen-

tence of the Synod, the Prefect at last wrote to
Nestorius,

‘bVVe have delayed long what seemed to be done by
the judgment of the Synod, although many greatly
blamed us and were instant that it should be. But now
the letters of your Holiness have been delivered to us,
shewing that the lingering at Ephesus is distasteful to
yOU, and that your Religiousness (1081108 to journey, we
have directed those, who ought to minister to you along
the whole journey‚ to minister to yOu [by sea or land],
on the whole way to your monastery ..... We do not
suppose that you need consolation, considering the wis-

dom of your soul, and the many thousand goods by which
you are endowed above all others.'

Nestorius in his answer accepts as a gift the
command to live in his monastery.

‘⁶ For nothing is more honourable to us, than a removal
for piety. But I beseech your Highness, for the sake
of religion, often to remind the pious Prince to set 0
note everywhere, by public Imperial letters, on the Ver-
bosities of Cyril which his Piety has adjudged, so that
it should be read throughout the orthodox Churches,
lest in the absence of letters of the pious Emperor, if
the writings of Cyril should be said to be condemned
by him, an occasion of scandal should arise to the simple,
08 if it were not said truly.'

Nestorius does not seem to mind his own depo-
8111011, 80 11101 1110 sentence against Oyril and Mem-

³ 00110. Ε1)11. Αο1. 111. 11111.
b Synodicon c. 24. The report mentioned by the delegates of
J ohn's party that Nestorius ⁶ was sent from EphesuS‚ to go where

he liked’ [Epist. Schismat. ad suos. in Eph. Conciliab. n. 12] was
accordingly inaccurate. c Synod. c. 25.
