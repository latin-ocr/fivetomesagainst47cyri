lxxxii PREFAOE.

If S. Cyril had any intimation of this mind of
the Antiochenes‚ it accounts for his sudden resolve
not to wait for them, but to accede to the wishes
of the other Bishops and open the Council without
them. The mind of the Church had been expressed
in the previous year. The 00110611 itself was only
a device of Nestorius to ward off his condemnation.
He had already been severed from the Communion
of the greater part of Christendom. The 00110611
tinople by Cyril, as agreeing mostly with the impiety of Arius,
Apollinarius, and Eunomius3' ‘the Sentence' states that the Synod
was ‘hurried by Cyril, in order that the Chapters which agree
with the evil and ungodly doctrine of Apollinarius and Arius and
Eunomius might not be enquired into.’ The letter to the other
Bishops of the 00110611 whom they had excommunicated‚ says that

they had ‘ abetted the lawless things done by Cyril of Alexandria
and. Memnon the Ephesiam, and maintained intercourse with men

of an heretical mind! They tell the Emperor, that they had so
done, ‘until they cast out and anathematize the Chapters sent out
by Cyril, full of the evil doctrine of Apollinarius and Eunomius
and Arius) John, 111 1116 own letter to the Clergy of Constanti-
nople, says that the sentence was passed ‘ until they anathematize
the heretical Chapters of Cyril the Alexandrian, and. receive
without guile the saith of the holy fathers gathered 00 Ν166,’ To
the Senate in Constantinople, they speak of their ⁶ ceasing from
their heretical and evil doctrine and recovering the faith of the
holy fathers of Nice‚’ 06 0116 condition of their being restored.
To the people of Constantinople they say, that they ‘ do not re-
fuse repentance -to the deposed and excommunicate, but would
open the doors of leving-kindness, if they will very speedily ana-
thematize the Chapters sent out by Cyril‚ which are alien from
the Apostolic and Evangelio teaching.' They still repeat in their
Relation to the Queens, that they ⁶ had deposed Cyril and Mem-
non, and removed them from the Episcopate‚ until they become
conscious of their wouuds and truly repent and anathematize the
1161601601 Chapters of Cyril, agreeing with this impiety of Apol-
linarius ete.' (Acta Conciliabuli post Aet. 1, 0006. Eph.) The

like was repeated in the later Aeta. of the Conciliabulum and in
Theodoret.
