lxxxiv PREFACE.

drawn troops from the garrison at Tripoli in Ly-
dia. It has been noticed that the seamen who
brought S. Cyril were ready to support him, and
the peasantry of the lands of the see of Ephesus
to support Memnon. The whole population of
Ephesus were enthusiastic in behalf of the ancient
doctrine, as they shewed by their exuberant joyt,
when the sentence, for which they had waited from
morning to evening, was announced.

It would be mere matter of imagination to pic-
ture anything further. But the second Council of
Ephesus, which became the Latrocinium under the
guidance of Dioscorus, was called just as legiti-
mately as the first.

However this may have been, it does not require
much humility to think that S. Cyril, in the midst of
the events, knew more than we, who see them only
through some fragmentary records of the past.
Even apart from the menace of Candidian‚ one so
long-sighted as S. Cyril must have known that he
would incur the grave displeasure of Theodosius,
by superseding his orders ; that there was a strong
prima-facie case of contravening them against him 3
and that the Emperor, who had written to him as he
had, was not one to be trifled with. Yet he braved
it all. It was of moment to the Churcl]‚ that the
heresy of Nestorius should be condemned. The sen-
tence once passed could not be reversed ; because the
whole Ohurch except the Antiochenes agreed in it.

So S. Cyril assented to the wish of the Council
not to delay, and braved the Emperor's displeasure,
expecting it to fall on himself alone.
