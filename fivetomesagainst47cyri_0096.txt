to the Emperor ‘¹, they urged leis restoration and the
deposition 01 S. Cyril. He had escaped in despight
01 them. They would not be persuaded that
Nestorius was 1116 11616110 which he was3 and they
would repeat that S. Cyri] was an Arian‚ Eunomian,
Apollinarian‚ although they must have known that
at the least 116 was neither Eunomian nor Arian.
There was nothing then for S. Cyril to do 111 16-
gard 10 them. They had fallen into the trap which
Nestorius had laid for them by sending the Ana-
themas meant to test his own sincerity‚ without
the Epistle which would have explained them. lt
became an axiom with Theodoret that they were
1161611061. S. Cyri] 111611 could but wait. S. Sixtus
iii„ a peace-loving Bishop who had succecded
S. Celestine, bears him witness that 116 116(1 shewed
at once how mindful he was 01 1116 161111 and how
regardless 01 001111111161166, which he suffered glori-
ously, according 10 1116 Apostle, wishing that 1116
Churches should 106 well-ordered, rather than that
116 should be righted himself3 that 0116 [Nestorius]
having wrecked himself, he was anxious 11161 611 1116
1661 should be saved out 01 1116 waves. ‘ The same
mind is in us also ; 10 601 tenderly towards 1116111,
when they cease 10 be impious towards God. Let
111066 111611, who will 10 16111111 10 1116 right way, be
received.’ He addresses S. Cyril himself,

‘ rHold fast, 111061 beloved brother, what has been done
by the Council‚ and what has been defined by us. For
a brother dismisses contumelies which benefit him be-
fore the Lord of all. For such contumely is victory.
