PREFACE. xcix

f Grod and his All. Many must have been his peace-
ful years before he was called out by the needs of
q his own people, to defend the truth of Grocl against a
living assailant. His work against the Emperor Ju-
lian (which even his opponent Theodoret admired ἃ,
111 the midst of his hottest hostility) was written,
116 says, on the exhortation of many, because the
ἓ heathen perplexed 0111131111113, alleging that he was
³ not refuted, because he could not ¹³. This 1311611 100
j} was written out of a love for souls. He himself
explained 10 Nestorius that, in his book on the Holy
3 Trinity, he had written some things akin to what
ξ he then wrote, but with no reference to him, since
÷· it was written before Nestorius himself wrote.

; Controversy was not his natural element. Cas-
siodorus counts him among those who were saidC at
least to have commented on the whole of Holy Scrip-
ture. His Commentaries are the largest portion of
Η13 extant works, yet these are but a part of a
} larger wholed. From these peaceful meditations
011 God’s word he was rousecl by the disturbanee of
ἶ 1113 monks through writings of Nestorius.
