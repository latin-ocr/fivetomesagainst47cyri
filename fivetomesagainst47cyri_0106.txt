It has been noticecl alreadye that types of our
Lord were the chief object of interest to him in his
first book on the Pentateuch‚ ‘ on the adoration in
spirit and iu trutht’ his faith in the Incarnation
and our union to Gocl through It, are naturally
prominent, as indeed it gleams through every-
where f. His was the exact contrary of the mind of
Theodore of Mopsuestia of the Antiochene school :
as has been said of. our Bishop Horne and another,
‘the oue sees Christ every where, the other no
wliere.' A mind which so meditates on God’s
word, not 011 particular expressions, but on the
whole, is not· that of the fierce controversialist
which some of late have pictured him.

It remains only 10 collect what has been said as
to the contents of this volume.

i. The Five books against Nestorius. ίἹ“11080,’ 113
has been said g, ‘ may be well called, a Defence of
S. Proclus. For S. Cyril in it mainly answers 13110

111 l). Joan. Evang. Vol. iii. Oxon.]. Vurious old authorities say
that 110 also wrote a Commentary ou S. Matthew, (Tillemont,
S. Cyr. ‹l'Alexandrie Art. 158. v. fin). [The fragments on the
Acts and catholic Ε11181108, published by the Abbe Migne, did not
appear to my son to furnish evidence of having formed a part of a
regular Commentary 1. c. p. 441. 445] Of the O.T. large frag-
ments of the Commentary 011 the Psalms and fragments of a Comm.
on J eremiah have been recovered by Card. Mai. It 18 certain that
110 wrote a commentary 011 Ezekiel. There are not a few frag-
ments of 1118 comment. on the Canticles. He also wrote on the
¹book of XVisilom. (See Card. Mai Bibl„ Nov. Patr. Τ. iii. Praef.)
