sermons preached by Nestorius against S. Proclus.
For the first two books are on the Virgin being
Θεοτόκος, and the term ‘birth' ascribed to G0d3
the third is of Hfis being our Priest‚ Who is God;
the fourth and fifth are for the most part on Grod
suffering and dying.’

S. Cyril himself says that he undertook the work
with reluctance, but that the homilies were written
in a popular and attractive style and were full of
heavy accusations against the doctrines of the
truth, and left him no ohoiceh. Nestorius is not
named in it. Hence it has been inferred that the
work was written before the Council of Ephesusi.
Photius notices that ‘in the first book, he refutes
six heads of the blasphemies of Nestorius3 in the
second, 143 in the third, 63 in the fourth and
fifth, 7 each.’ He addsj that ‘his mode of inter-
pretation is framed according to his wonted way
01 expression, yet brought down to a lower style.'

ii. The Scholia are said by Photius to ‘ contain
much which is usefuL’ S. Cyril, with his wonted
simplicity, speaks 01 them as ‘ k brief expositions of
the dispensation of Christ, very good and useful.'
A modern writer says, ‘1 The Value of the work
may be inferred from this, that scarce any subse-
quent writer, who employed the authority of Cyri]
in explaining the mystery of the Incarnation, failed
to take a passage or more from the Scholia.' This
work also was quoted, with two other passages 01
S. Cyril, among the testimonies from the books of
Catholic fathers, appended to the Epistle 01 S. Leo
