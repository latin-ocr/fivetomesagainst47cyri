Emmanuel, One; Jesus, One3 i.e. One Lord, 820.
F urther, how the Word is said to have been ‘ emp-

proper Body, and how the Holy Virgin is said to
be Theotocos. Lastly, that the Only-Begotten,
appearing in visible flesh is called God and Man3
how He suffered: in which last he refutes those

¹ ⁶ J esus the Christ 3’ and in what respect the Word
of Grod is called Man3 then, in what respect the
Word of God is said to have been emptied3 and‘
how Christ is One, and how Emmanuel is One3
and what we say is the Union, and about the coal
which Elias saw, and other things like 'these’

iii. That Christ is One. The treatise must have
been written after the condemnation of Nestorius,
since he is refuted by name in it. It must, how-

since it is quoted by Andrew of Samosata. It is

y Cod. 169.
