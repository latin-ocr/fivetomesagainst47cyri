CYRIL

THE MOST HOLY ARCHBISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA

FIVE-BOOK CONTRADICTION OF THE BLASPHEMIES OF NESTORIUS

ΟΒ ΤΗΕ FIVE TOMEs OF S· CYRIL.

¹ Truth of human writings must be tested by Scripture. Arian errors and against

Holy Ghost. Errors of heretics on their heads. Nestorius’ book of Holnilies.
S. John i. l,3‚ 14, 18. True Union of Person. Mother of God. ‘⁶ Made Flesh ;”
Manichees have no plea; without it, the curse and decay would still have
been our lot. ‘⁶ Mother of God’' except it express a Truth, may no ways
be allowed. ‘ Passed through‚’ obj ected to. To be 1ncarnate, belongs to one
who was, before He was Man. ‘⁶ Mixture” of old used in right sense.
One of Nestorius’ sermons quoted as owning God and Man in one.
συνάφεια. Α mother, mother of a man, though the body only is taken of
her. Elizabeth mother of S. John the Baptist. Eusebius of Dorylaeum op-
poses Nestorius in church. Gon the SoN had two Births. The Creed of
Nicea on the Incarnation. The Creed recited. Nestorius cites from that
of Constantinople. “lucarnam‘’ begotten after the flesh. If it did but mean
indwelt it would be common to all. S. John’s most careful accurate lan-
guage. That the Virgin Mary bare God‚ does not exclude the Eternal
Generation, nor render her an object of worship.

Tnosu who wish to explore the holy Scripture and who
drive away negligence in doing s0, and thirst rather for
the attainment thereof, and apply themselves vigorously
and apart from all sloth—the being in every good shall be
their's, for they fill their mind with the Divine Light : and
then applying it to the doctrines of the Chureh‚ they admit
every thing that is right and unadulterate, and that most
readily‚ and lay it up in the hidden treasures of their soul,
and rejoiee as much in what they in their desire of know-
ledge have collected, as others who are worldly 1, 111 insati-
ably colleoting Indian gems or gold, yea rather, yet more:
for wisclom is better than costly stanes, (md every precious Prov.viii'.
thing] is not worthy of laer, as it is written. For I say that 11.
they who are wise and prudent and skilled in the Divine
doctrines, ought to remember what has been profitably
written by one of the holy Disciples, Boethi-en try the spirits 1 s, John
whether they be of God. And the Divine Paul says that to iv. ¹·
the saints has been given discerm'ny of spirits.
