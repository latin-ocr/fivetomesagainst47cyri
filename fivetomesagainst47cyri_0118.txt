4 S. John proclaims Gocl 17ιο Son Gon: and become Mem, ’

low] that which is for the good of our flock and is crowned
by the Truth itself with testimonies to its rightness ⁰.
And this I say having met with a certain book compiled
by some one, having a large collection of homilies, orderly
and systematically arranged and in no wise lacking in (1110
appliances for the reader. And if ought had bee'n said by
its author, which by passing into forgetfulness should come
to nought, I would have deemed it a duty both myself to
hold my peace and to counsel others to do the same; lest
things so unmeetly8 and unheedfully said should become
known to many 0111015, 01111 10 those after us. But since a
multitude of blasphemies has been heaped into 11115 book
and some great accusation has been made, baying against
the doctrines of the truth, how was it not necessary that we

a ο- 111 111111 should (so to say) strip for combat 9 and should fight
¹ in behalf of its readers, that they may not take harm thence,

but may rather know how to repulse bravely the damage
from what is unrightly said? For the Divine John was called
by Christ the Saviour of us all the Son of 1711101101, 01111 with
reason, for that he well-nigh sounded forth o'er all beneath .

dread and mighty Mystery 01 1110 Incarnation of the Only· ¹

at length begin the allwise economy that for our sakes and
