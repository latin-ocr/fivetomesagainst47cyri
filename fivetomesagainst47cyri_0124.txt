appeared to us, not from the earth like the first, but from
Hcaven. For the Word That is from above and from forth
the Father hath come down not into the fiesh of any one nor
into alien flesh (as I already said), nor again hath He (166-
cended upon any one of those like us to dwell in him, as
He was in the Prophets 3 but having made His own the body
which was from forth a woman and born from her after the
Flesh, He gathered up 4 man's birth through Himself, made
as we after the flesh, Who is before all ages from the Father.
This confession of saith the Divine Scriptures delivered to
us. But THOU seignest to fear lest any of us should sup-

But that thou dost accuse the Birth after the fiesh of
the Word, every way declaring two sons and dividing the

One Lord J esus Christ, shall be shewn not by my words
but by thine own.
