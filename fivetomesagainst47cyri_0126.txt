caught insulting rather the august one, than (as you sup-
pose and say) electing to honour her, by allotting to her a

perh. if name hated of God? For 110132 to those whom we determine

fo not

to honour [do] we give names whereby the glory of the
Supreme Nature is dishonoured, first of all we shall un-
awares be involving our own selves in the charge of such
impiety, next we shall do them no slight wrong, decking
as if in honour those we praise with what 16 no praise‚ and
weaving for them a laudation hated of God.

One may moreover marvel at this too: that striking right
and left at 13116 words of the unholy heretics and in no wise

truth‚ and reck little about any longer appearing wise.

For do you not say that Elisabeth too or any other of the ¹

holy women is worthy of all reverence‘? will you then not
grudge it, if any one choose to 0611 them too ‹mothers of
God, .? But I suppose that you will surely and utterly with-
stand them and say, This is not 60 3 for they bare sanctified

men and none among them was God by Nature. Hence .

either drive away this from every woman 3 or if you allow
the holy Virgin alone among all to have it, what words will
you use for your defence? For if it be true of her and she
has truly borne G0d‚ in that the Word of God has been

made flesh, confess this with 116, 611(1 you will free yourself
