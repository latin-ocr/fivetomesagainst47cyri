But since taking (I know not whence) the word passed
ἰὴν-011911, you have applied it to God, explain the word ς
the meaning of the passaqe throuylz here spoken of, will
belong to your wisdom to tell us who know it not. For
if the Word of God so passed through her, as to pass from
one place to another, you cast Him down forthwith 5 for

’ii. you will hear Him saying by the voice of the saintS, Do

not I fill Hoeaven (md earth saith the Lord? Fornot 111 111300
15 the Godhead nor knoweth It bodily changes of place,
f01 it filleth all things. But if while awaiting the fit

- period of bir 1511, Ηο made an incidental7 indwelling 111 111311,

and so you say that God made passage thiough the holy

0ῑῇΙῖ rho oly Virgin‚ or passed thr 011ῃῆ 1101 (for I will use in all thy holy

But you feel suspicious of the applause 35 though it came
to you from the people for having chosen to speak right
things ’.Ρ for having called Him Who was born of the holy
Virgin Sun of righteousness and Lord of all3 you then
again feign to speak with 111001510118, and find fault with

you of not having understood. O great strength which
