16 Gon the SON Incarnate : Gon ever (md become Mem.

„the 2002·ch by the 1111111 VVhom He appointed, Izafvz‘ny qiven
„assumam unio all men in Hzat He raised Him from the>
„dead Having first said, By the Mem, he then adds, In
„that He raised Hz'm from the dead, that no one might sup-
„pose that the Godhead Incarnate had died. „

Who then is He Who was Incarnate, or in what way was
He incarnate, what Godhead was incarnate, tell (O most
excellent sir) to us who would learn it. Shall we grant that
the Word, God out of God, was Incarnate, and say that He
was made Man, as having been made as we and born in
fiesh? or shall we allow this in no wise, but suppose that a
man came hereto, connected with God, according to thee?
But you will (1 suppose) say, that it is better and wise to
think that the Word out of God was Incarnate and made
fiesh, according to the Scriptures ι for one is not 1 suppose
seen assuming that wherein one is, but if one come some-
how to be 111 that wherein one was not at first, reason will
forthwith admit that something new has been wrought re-
garding him. Hence it is unlearned to say that any of us
having stepped forth of the definitions of human nature
have been incarnate and been made flesh 3 but 1110 111031113-
11011, or being made 110511, will beseem (and that with much
reason) the Nature That is beyond humanity. But if He
was truly Incarnate and has been made flesh, He is accre-

‘ov dited as Man 4, and 1101 -connected with a man, by mere

indwelling or external relation or connection, as YOU say.
Yet even though He became Man, He possesseth the being

- God in 311 security 5, nor do we say that any change took

place of the fiesh into the Nature of Godhead‚ and we hold
that neither did the reverse take place, for the nature of the
Word 113111 101113111οᾶ what it 15 even when united to fiesh.
What no one therefore even in bare idea thinks of hold-

6 ee e- ing, why do you putting this in your book ⁶, as though ac-

' tually uttered‚ pretend 10 be contending for the doctrines

of piety? For the name mixture g, some of the holy fathers
too have put: but since you say that you are afraid lest
any confusion be deemed to take place, as in the case of
liquids mingled with one another, 1 rid you from your fears, .
