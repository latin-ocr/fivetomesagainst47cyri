But you will perchance deem that that empty wordk of

¹³ This word συνάπτω and its noun
συνάφεια, S. Cyri] had used long before
to express the kind of Union which
Christ gives us with Himself. S. Cyril
says, ‘⁴ For as elsewhere He says that
He is a Vine, we the branc-lies, shewing
that not alien nor of other kind are the
branehes from the Vine but of it by
nature, so here He says that He is our
foundation (1 Cor. iii. 11) in order to
shew the natural kindship to Him when
He was made man, of them which are
built upon Him. For then are we con-
nected (συναπτόμεθα) with Him by na-
ture too, and suspended as it were from
our relation to Him as the branches from
the vine, we bear the fruit of piety to
God-ward,‘' Thes. cap. 15. p. 171 c d.
“ If on receiving Christ’s Spirit we are
through It brought near to God the
Father, as made partakers of His Divine
Nature, how is It a thing made, through
which we are connected (συναπτόμεθα)
with God as being now His offspring 2⁰
Thes. cap. 34- p. 360 D. And in his trea-
tise de Trinitate written more than five
years beforethis date, S. Cyril says‚‘· Nor
could human nature any otherwise have
been partaker of the Divine Nature, had
it not gained this through the Son as Me-
diator, receiving it as a natural (φυσικὸν)
mode of connection (συναφείας),” Dial.
i. p. 406 a ι “ we are temples of the
Spirit Who existeth and is, we are called
therefore gods as being participant with
the Divine and Ineffable Nature, by
connection (συναφείᾳ) with It,'’ Dial.
7 p. 639 fin. Of God the Son’s union
with His human nature, S. Cyril says,
“ But that the SoN was Lord‚ before His
concurrence with flesh and His connection
therewith through union (καὶ τῆς καθ’
ἕνωσιν συναφείας) we shall see without
any trouble‚” Dial. 6. p. 605 d. S.
Cyril then used the word to denote our
union with Christ in which our own
personality is preserved to us entire.
When he speaks of the Incarnation in
which God the Son’s hiunan nature was
so made His own, by Union with Him,
as to have no distinct or separate person-
ality‚ S. Cyril uses connection by wa. of
union, a connection that makes the wo
natures but One.

Nestorius on the other hand following
his own earlier teaching speaks of a con-
nection between God the Son and His
human nature no closer than that of any
holy person with Christ.

The empty word is found in the creed
against which Charisius priest and
η steward of the Church in Philadelphia

brought a complaiut before the Council
of Ephesus (t. iii. 1205 sqq. ed. Col.),
and of which Marius Mercator gives a
Latin Translation (see On the clause And
the Son, pp. 76, 77 and note): he gives it
at pp. 41 sqq. ed. Baluz. with the head-
ing, Now tlte setting forth of the corrupt
saith oftke above mentioned Theodore, and
further on, pp. 186 sqq. when giving the
session that was holden aboutCharisius,
he givesit over againinaslightlydifferent
translation with the‘heading Nestoi-ian
Creed. This Theodore to whomit is attri-
buted was a contemporary of S. Chry-
sostom about half a century before and
was Bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia.
To this empty word S. Cyl-il opposed
his Personal Union (καθ’ ὑπόστασιν ἔ-
νωσις). Fleury (Eccl. Hist. Bk. 25 §S
fin.) speaks of, as the first place in which
he has met the expression S. Cyril's
end Letter(the firstOEcumenical Letter)
to Nestorius in which he says, “The
Word having united to Himself Per-
sonally flesh ensouled with a rational
soul ⁷³ (see 3 Epistles Parker 1872 p. 56).
ln the final Letter which S. Cyril and
his Council of Alexandria wrote A. D.
430 to Nestorius were appended 12 Ana-
themas which Nestorius was required
to sign (3 Epistles p. 68). These Ana-
themas or Chapters were much misun-
derstood by John Archbishop of An-
tioch, and his suffragans in Cilicia,
Palestine‚ Euphratesia διο, who thought
that they contained Apollinarian error3
Liberatus who wrote about 125 years
after tells us in his Breviarium (cap. 4
Gallandi Bibl. Patr. Vet. xii. 127) that
John of Antioch ‘⁶ sent to Andrew and
Theodoret, Bishops os his Council to re-
ply in writing to the 12 chapters as re-
newing the dogma of Apollinaris.' ⁷ Theo-
doret too in sending his replies back to
John sends him a letter beginning,“ Ι was
greatly grieved on reading the Anathe-
mas which you sent me, hidding me an-
swer them in writing and lay bare to all
their heretica] meaning.⁷’ S. Cyril de-
fended his Anathemas or Chapters
against the exceptions made by Andrew
and Theodoret separately: in the close
of his Letter to his Priest Eulogius, his
Proctor at Constantinople, he says that
he sends the Provost (iuter alia) copies of
his answers to each of these BishopS.
The second chapter begins, “ If any con-
fess not that the Word out of God the
Father has been united to fleslz Person-
all, , καθ’ὑπόστασιν ἧνῶσθαι.” No pos-
sibie misunderstanding of this term,
