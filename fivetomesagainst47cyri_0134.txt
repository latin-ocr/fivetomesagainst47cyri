to have occurred to S.Cyril, for in his
Explanation of his Chapters made at
the request of the Synod in order that
they should be clearer (as the title tells
115), during the days while the Council
was awaiting its dismissal, as Alexander
of Hierapolis writes to Constantinople
to John of Anffloch, S.Cyril does not
allude to this. There is no trace of
Andrew Bishop of Samosata having
written against this 2nd chapter nor
against the fifth and sixth: so probably
no objection occurred to him either.
Nor does Eutherius bishop of Tyana
in his Letter to John of Antioch‚ run—
ning briefly through the Chapters, ex-
cept against the Persona! Union. Theo-
doret objects tc the term, Persomtl
Union, from its novelty and from its
appearing to imply mixture. Again in
his letter to the monks of Euphratesia,
Osroene, Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia,
giving briefiy his objections to some
of the Chapters, he repeats that the ex-
pressions Persona! Um'on and coneur-
rence (σύνοδον) by Natural Union‚teach
some mixture and confusion of the Form
of God and the form of the servant (Ep.
151 p. 1292 fin.) In answer to Theodo-
ret’s objection to the second chapter(writ-
ten perhaps but a few weeks after this
present treatise.) S. Cyril explains the
term and sayS, Seeivg that Nestorius is

S. Cyril uses the word habitually eg.
it occurs five times in his Treatise to the
Prinoesses Arcadia and Marina on the
right saith: he uses also other like ex-
pressions, true um'071, true and Natural
Union,inseverable, z'mlz'ssoluble. S. Eu-
logius, one of S. Cyril’s successors in
his see (A. D. 581) anda contemporary
of Pope S, Gregory‚ in his famous ex-
planation that the Council of Ephesus
forbad oppositions to, not definitions of,
the Fasth, alludes to this expression and
says, For it [the Council of Ephesus]
does define what none before it defined.
