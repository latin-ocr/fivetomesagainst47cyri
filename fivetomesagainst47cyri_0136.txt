she is the source of the fiesh only, believed to bear the whole
man, made up (1 mean) of soul and body, although she 0011-
tribute nothing of her own to the being of the 00111. Yet
when one says man, 0110 signifies surely the 00111 united to
the body. As therefore the woman, albeit she bear the
body alone, 10 00111 to bear him that is made up of soul and
body, and this no wise damages the account⁹ of the soul,
as though it found 111 fiesh the origin of its being ¹¹3 so will
you conceive as to the blessed Virgin too : for even though
0110 be mother of the holy Flesh, she hath nevertheless
borne God the Word out of God truly united thereto ⁰, and
though any 0011 her Mother of God, he will not be defining
a more recent beginning ¹ of God the Word nor that the
flesh hath been made the commeneement of His Being:
but will understand rather the mode of the eeonomy and
wondering at it will say, O Lord, Ι leave heard Thy heariny
and zoas afraid, I considered Thy worlfs (11111 zoas astonied.

But our all-wise and prudent expounder, having pondered
the force of the example says, ,‚ Thus the holy Virgin too,
„even though 0110 1101311 borne man, God the Word passing
„along with him, yet not therefore is she Mother of God:
„for not from the blessed Virgin was the Dignity of the
,‚Word‚ but He was God by Nature.'’

What therefore is the meaning of, that the 111ῙοΓᾶ passed
forth along with the flesh, 110 010110 knows, but I marvel
much at his subtil refinement 2. For the word of truth
