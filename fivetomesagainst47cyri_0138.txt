24 S. John Baptist received Srlffl'r3 Gon the Son born.

Elizabeth hath confessedly borne the blessed Baptist an-
' ted in the womb with the Holy Ghost z and if it had been
any where said by the God-inspired Scriptures, that the -
Spirit too was made fiesh, rightly would you have said that
5110 ought to be called by us mother of the Spirit3 but if
the bairn 7 is said to have been honoured with bare anoint-
ing only, why (100111 you it right to put the fact8 of incarna-
tion on an equal footing with the grace of participation? for
it is not the same thing, to say that the Word was made
fiesh and that one has been anointed through the Spirit
with prophetic spirit. For of the holy Virgin it is writ-
ten, Belzold (ι ῙῘίνψῙη shall conceive aoid bear a Son, and He
who is hornis called the fruit and moreover Emmanuel,
which bciny 'lutet-lvnctccl is, Gocl ‘avith us; but of Elizabeth,
she shall bem· a 5011 who shall 90 before Him sin the spirit}
ancl power of Elias, and shall 90 before the face of tlte
Lorcl {0 prepare Has ways. By no means therefore is Eli-
zabeth mother of the Spirit, for she bare a prophet of the
ngjlzcst: but the holy Virginis truly mother of God (ἰ, for
she hath borne carnally, i. 0., according to the flesh, God
united to flesh. For since she is human who bare, therefore
and rightly do we say that the mode of generation has been
wrought in human wise 3 for thus and no otherwise was it
possible that He Who is over all nature could become as
we, not slighting the being what He is (how could He ἲ)
but rather abiding what He was andis and will be: for
superior to change 15 the Divine and Most High Nature.

(1 S. Cyril uses exactly the same ex- i. e. according to the flesh. . . . Saying
pression in his Letter to the Monks according to theflesh is not taking away
(Epp. 8 c) and in the first of the c-hap- the miraculousness of the Birth . . . .
ters that he a pended to his great Letter but teaches that as God begets Divinely
to Nestorius see note k), “ Ifany con· or in God-befitting manner according to
sess not that Emmanuel is God in His own Nature, so too man humanly

God made flesh, be he anathelna.” Theodoret’s objection to S. Cyril‘s
But the word carnally or after the. flesh first chapter is of a different kind and is
was not understood by many: e. g. identical with that of Nestorius (above
Andrew Bishpp of Samosata thought p.7‚ below p. 33 and note b): the notion
that 1t 0011tradlcted the miraculous Birth that γεγέννηκε, she ΙιαΗι borne, necessi-
from 'a virgin. S. Cyril explains his tates the conversion ofthe Godhead into
meamng in h1s reply to Andrew ; “ we flesh. In Andrew's case, the meaning
sald that the Virgm bare the Word of of the word σαν-7101100155 misunderstood,
