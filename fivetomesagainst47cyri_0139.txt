¹¹ Eusebius an Advocate at Constan-
tinople ; he afterwards put out a protest
addressed to the Clergy and Laity of
that City (Cone. Eph. part. i. cap. 13
t. iii. 888 ed. Col.) that Nestorius was
reviving the false teaching of Paul of
Samosata, condemned nearly two cen-
turies before (Marius Mercator, whose
translation into Latin of S. Cyril's De-
fences of his 12 chapters or Anathemas
against Nestorius' errors and of his
Scholia on the Inearnation, has come
down to us, likewise put out a paper of
like kind, Opera pp. 50 sqq. ed. Baiuz
1684). Many years on we read of Euse-

accuser betore S.Flavian, Archbishop
of Constantinople. In November 448,
a Synod was called of Bishops who
chanced from one cause or another to be
there: these amounted to thirty. The
circumstance of Constantinople being
the capital of the Eastern Empire ocea-
sioned Bishops to be often there. (The
Archbishop of Alexandria though appa-
rently he had habitually one of his
Deacons there, as a sort of deputy, or
Proctor‚ in the Imperial City, seems
on more especial occasions to have had
a Bishop there: e. g. S. Cyril sent his
great synodal Letter to Nestorius by
four Bishops, TheopemptuS‚ Daniel,
Potamon and Comarius ι of these Theo-

emptus Bishop of Cabasa and Daniel

ishop of Darnis, went to Ephesus and
vored in the Council: Potamon and
Comarius remained at Constantinople,
for one of S. Cyril’s earliest Letters
after the Council (Epp. p. 84) was
directed to them conjointly with the
great Archimandrite Dalmatius, the
Priest Eulogius, S. Cyril's Proct0r‚
and another. A brief letter of S.Cyril's

rected to Theopemptus‚ Potamon and
Daniel. Fleury (bk. 26 ξ 3) suggests
that Theopemptus and Daniel went
back to Constantinople with Letters
from the 001111611.) Before this Synod
the Bishop Eusebius accused Eutyches,
who was condemned. The August of
the next year, 449, the Robber-Council
of Ephesus deposed S. Flavian (whose
Martyrdom followed immediately for
he was driven into exile to Epipa in
Lydia and died there) and Eusebius.
Eusebius was likewise ejected from his
See and stayed at Rome as Pope S. Leo
tells the Empress Pulcheria in a letter
(S. Leo ad Pulch. 59 [79 col. 1037 ed.
Ball.] cited by Fleury 27, 49 english
translation) : Eusebius was at the Coun-
eil of Chalcedon, he was vindicated at
the close of the lst Session (t. iv. 1189
001). Ι11 the third Session he presents to
the Council a petition against Diosco-

(ib. 1737). A rescript of the Emperor
Marcian annuls all that had been done
against him. This Rescript addressed
