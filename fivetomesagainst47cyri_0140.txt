Chalcedon itself; for when that Coun-

John Archbishop of Antioch to which
they gave the Eeumenical sanction of
the Church, some of the Bishops called
0111,Εὐσέβιος Νεστόριον καθεῖλε, Ense-
bins deposed Nestorius. Itis likewise
mentioned by Evagrius (Eccl. Hist. i. 9)
who says, τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν τοῦ δορυλαίου
διέποντος, ὃς καὶ ῥήτωρ ἔτι τυγχάνων,
πρῶτος τὴν Νεστορίου βλασφημίαν διέ-

Dorylaeum, who while yet an advocate

first convicted the blasphemy οἵ Nestorius.

Leontius (in the 7th century) writing
against Nestorius and Eutyches (contra
Nest. et Eutych. lib. 3 in Galland. Bibl.

Vet. Pan-um xii. 697) speaks ofit too.

⁵ The people‘s applause during the ⁴
sermons of S. Augustine and S. Chry-
sostom are often mentioned: Nestorius
alludes to the applause of his own ser-
mons a little above, p. 11. Two or
three years later when the troubles which
followed on the council through the
Eastern Bishops misunderstanding S.
Cyril and his language, were beginning
to be allayed‚ and one of them, the pious
and aged Paul Bishop of Emesa, was
preaching at Alexandria before the
Archbishop‚ the very words that the
people uttered in their delight are pre-
served to us (conciliat. iii. 1617, 16:21
ed. Col.). Here Eusebius' cry was one
of zeal for the Faith, contradicting the
denia] of Truth which he heard.
