by US, that we conceive not of two sons (as though it were SGoN Πέῇξ

necessary if the births be two, that two sons also should tw ene
be introzduced) let him come forward and tell us whichr raitons
of the generations he will admit, that before the ages from
out the Father, wherein the Word was God not yet Incar-
nate, or this one, recent and out of a woman.

If then he say that alone, I mean the one before the
ages from 0111 1110 Father, that one alone will be Son Who
is out of Him by Nature and not yet participate of flesh
and blood: and vainly (as it seems) is the Mystery of the
Incarnation uttered, and in no wise hath He emptied Him-
self nor been made in servant's form, but hath remained
thus, rejecting the true concurrence 8 with flesh even until S σύνοδον
now. But he who is in the last times out of woman, shall
be styled by himself son, and we will admit this one gene-
ration, I mean out of woman 3 needs has the Word out of
God the Father fallen away from being by Nature Son.

But the pious man sees full surely the absurdity of such
ideas and its exceeding swerving 111110 impiety. In order
then that we may proceed along the royal road, we say
that two were the Births, one the Son through both, the
Word out of God not yet made in flesh, the Same after-
wards Incarnate and enduring for us the birth of a woman
after the flesh. For if one said in regard of men that two
sons must surely be conceived of, if we speak of two births,
he would say rightly and it would be true,- but since the
Mystery of Christ and the mode of the Incarnation hath an-
other path 9, and is not beheld in like wise with what is θὸδὸν
01115, why is he, looking at our habitS, and then fastening his
mind on what is marvellous and above speech, caught fall·
surprises me is this z he confessing herein that the Church “““““““
knows one Son, and adding, The Lord Christ, hath no
longer kept One, for he sunders one from another things
united, and putteth each apart, not enquiring what the
