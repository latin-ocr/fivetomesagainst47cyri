Virgin. That believing on Christ Jesus, we believe in
the One and by Natme and truly Son, our faith moun-
ting up unto the Father through Him, will be clear, in
that He Himself hath cried aloud to the whole world, He
that believeth οη ΜΘ believeth not on 11Ιο but on Hem that
sent Me, and he that seeth Me seetlz Him that sent Me, and
again, Believe οη ezod, ακησῑ believe 016 Me. And we do not
(Ι suppose) say that He asks of us two faiths, but rather
He teaches that if any admit the 161111 10 Himward, he hath
believed on the Father Hiniself.

But since (as is probable) he will be making use of the
community 1 of the 11611168, saying that Christ and Lord, yea
and Son, 616 00111111011 111168, and will be affirming that they
suit the Word That sprung of the Father even though He
be conceived of as alone and not yetz participate of flesh,
and likewise the Temple that sprang of a virgin, this
matter needs (I think) considerable investigation: put-
ting it off for 1116 present 10 6 8668011 (68 Ι said) fitly be-
longing 10 11, 161 118 go 10 611011161- utterance of the holy 2
85711οᾶ which this man perverting unto 1118 own liking, does ἰ
violence to the force of 1111111. For 116 says that the fathers ’,
have written, We believe ‘in One Lorcl Jesnss Christ, the ³
