Yet how is it nob

obvious to all that the Only-Begotten being God by Na-
ture has been made man, not by connection simply (as he

alone That is of God the Father, be he
anathema.⁷' Neither Andrew nor Theo-
doret understood this chapter; Andrew
allows that the words must not be allotted
to two persons. and uses the term ἄκρα
of the Union of God and Man both here
and on chapter 11 01111, just as S. Cyril
Hom. Pasch. 7. p. 102 d had said τὸ εἰς
ἄκρον ἑνοῦν and in the Hom. 16 (A.D.
20) 50 often quoted by Andr-ew, p. 2301)
(as well as at p. 17 above and elsewhere)
had used the expression τὴν εἰς ἄκρον
ἕνωσιν [Nestorius ξ ὃ, below p. 64 had
called it ἄκρα συνάφεια]; but appears
to think that S. Cyril 11311 denied any dis-
tinction of the words at all. Theodoret
after an allotment to the Human nature
of our Lord of words said by Him of
His Human nature. shews his misunder-
standing of S. Cyril's chapter by adding
what is quite true, but is equally ad-
mitted by S. Cyril, ‘¹ Hence, the things
spoken and wrought in God-befitting
sort, we will 31101 to God the VVord,
those spoken and wrought in lowly wise
to the servant's form, lest we fall into
the sickness of Arius' and Eunomius'
blas hemy.”
hat S.Cyril is objecting to is the
11011011 11131 He who is One with the Fa-
ther is God the Son absolutely distinct
from His own Μ311110011, 11131 Ηο who
said, My God My God why forsoolcest
Τ hoa Me is, not God the Son, speaking of
and through the Manhood which He had
for ever united to Himself but, a man
distinct and apart. But even in his
quite early writings S. Cyril had never
overlooked what the Eastern Bishops
were (a year or two after this trea-
tise was written) so anxious to have
brought prominently forward, viz. that
“as to the Gospel and Apostolic words
concerning the Lord, we know that Di-
vines make some common, as to One
Person, apportion others. as to two Na-
tures, and give to Christ the God-befitting
according to His Godhead, the lowly
ones according to His Manhood ” (Con-
fession of Eastern BishopS, approved by
S. Cyril and incorporated by him in 1115
Ecumenical letter to John of Antioeh,
Three Epistles p. 72). In his Thesaurus
cap. x init.. S. Cyril says, ‘⁵ But we
must know and believe that the VVord
being God and consubstantial in all
things with the Father, put on man's
nature and 113111 been made Man. in
order that He may both sometimes speak
as man by reason of the Econoniv with
flesh, and may also as God utter the
things above 111311 as so being hy Nature

and when opportunity introduces the
need of this. But if any one should
wish 10 refer the things which are more
humanly and economically spoken (as
Ι 53111) to His Godhead and again to
refer the things which are Divinely
spoken to 1110 111110 wherein He has
been made man, such an 0110 will wrong
the nature of things and will destroy
the Economy: for one while He saith
as God, Verih I say to you, before
Abraham was. am, and again, I have
come down from out qs heaven. If
0110 wishes to preserve to Him only the ·
God-befitting Dignity‚ he will utter-
ly take away His being made man in
the last times (for He was not in human
nature before Abraham was nor yet has
He as man come down from Heaven):
and again if one should choose to attri-
bute to bare God the Word before the
Incarnation the words and acts of the
human nature, such an one will do im-
piously : for what will he do when Christ
says Now has My Soul been troubled and
is very sorrozqful? will he admit that
sorrow and dismay befel the Nature of
God and that sear of death gat hold
thereos? what when he sees Him cruci-
fied, will he admit that the Godhead of
the Son suffered this just as man? or
will herepudiate the blasphemy? There-
fore let what 15 suitable thereto be kept
to each time and fact and let Theology
altit? ἷῗέἓθὲῖὲὲῗ 8111511ἓὲ ξῗοὲξέξιῖἳὲξ
as man, but those whence He is from
forth the Father as Son and God; and
let it allow to the Economy with flesh
that He should sometimes say what does
not belong to the Godhead bare and by
Itself.'' pp. 72, 73. See also de Trinitate

and through the Homily. These belong
to the earlier years of S. Cyril's Episco-
ate : they do not differ from what
“. Cyri] wrote about this time, in ex-
planation of his fourth chapter, and in
reply to Andrew's criticisms, p. 171 3 b,
nor from what. in A.D. 432 when the
Egpytian and Eastern Churches had
explained to one another what each
meant. S. Cyril wrote to Aeacius Bishop
of Melitene as being what the Eastern
Bishops said and as being one of the
essentia] points in which they diflered
