union, ineffable and passing understanding. And thus He ἰξιξίετι·

is conceived of as One and Only, and every thing said6 θᾶπαςλό-
befits Him and au ψῃ] be said of one Person. For the {2²23

lncarnate Nature ⁶ of the Word Himself is after the Union {ngfl‘ss’

i now conceived of as One, just as will reasonably be con-
* ceived in regard to ourselves too, for ·man is really One,

compounded of unlike things, soul I mean and body. But
it is necessary now too to notify that we say that the Body

’ united to God the Word is ensouled with a reasonable

Soul. And I will for profit's sake add this too ε other
than the Word out of God is the flesh, in regard to its
proper nature, other again Essentially the Nature of the
Word Itself. But even though the things named be con-
ceived of as diverse and sundered in diverseness of nature,
yet is Christ conceived of as One out of⁷ both, the Godhead ⁷ ἐξ
and manhood having come together one to another in true
union.

And the God-inspired Scripture confirms us hereto by
ten thousand words and acts ε using similitudes whereby
one may (and that without labour) clearly advance so as
we may behold the Mystery of Christ. The blessed Pro-
phet Isaiah said therefore, And there was sent to me one os Isa. vi.
the Seraphim and in his hand ct live θοαί which he had taken 6, 7‘
with the tonys from off the altar and he touched m y mouth and

said, Lo this hath touched thy lips ζωαί shall tcthe away thtne

iniquities and purye thy sins.

And searching according to

our power into the depth of the vision, we say that none

⁰ μία ’γὰρ ἤδη νοεῖται φύσις μετὰ
τὴν ἕνωσιν ἡ αὐτοῦ τοῦ Λόγου σεσαρ-
κωμένου. S. Cyri] in his second Letter
to Successus bisho of Diocaesarea in
Isauria, written pro ably about 3 years
after this, explains the Term One Na-
ture Incarnate thus, “For evenis the
Only-Begotten Son of God Incarnate
and Made man be said by usto be One,
He has not therefore been mixed up (as
some please to think) nor has the Na-
ture of the Word passed into the nature
of the flesh nor yet that of the flesh into
His Nature, but, while each abides and
is conceived of in its natural property,
He united unspeakably and unutterably
shewed us One Nature of the Son, yet

(as Ι said) Incarnate. For not merely
of things which are simple by nature is
the One rightly used, but also of those
which are brought together as com-
pounded; such as is man, of soul and
body: for such things are diverse in
form aud not consubstantial one to an-
other ς yet united, they made up one na-
ture of man, albeit in the plan of the
compounding, the difference of nature
in the things brought together into
Union exists.” Epp. p. 143a b c. The
great estimation in which this letter was
held is indicated by its frequent citations
in controversies on the Incarnation.
