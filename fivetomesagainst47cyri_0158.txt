44 Apollinarianism dreaded by N asmo-ias ancl by T lwodoret.

„ling having taken place and the two natures not divided‚
„nought of the meaner things were taken of the human
,‚ nature, and they had place at length against the Divi-
,‚nityf, as though all things were spoken of One, not in

[les Apollinaristes] soutenoient, apres
les Ariens, qu'il avoit une seule nature
mixte et composee de la divine et de
l'humaine ι 111813 113 38 reduisoient a dire
que sa chair estoit consubstantielle a sa
divinite, qu‘une partie du Verbe avoit
este changee en chair, en os, en clieve11X‚
en un mot en un corps et en une nature
toute differente de la sienne, que ce
n'avoit pas este 1111 corps comme lenos-
tre, qu'il cn avoit seulement la forme et
l'apparence exterieure, mais qu'il estoit
8081811181 a la nature divine, forme de la
substance mesme de la sagesse eternelle
et de celle du Verbe changee en un corps
passible: Qu’ainsi c'estoit la substance
mesme de la sagesse qui avoit 8188 18
monde, et la divinite du Fils consubstan-
tielle au Pere, qui avoit este circoncise
et attachee a la croix; et non un corps
terrestre comme le nostre.

Ils ajoutoient, par une consequence
bien naturelle de ce faux principe, que
la substance de son corps n’estoit pas
prisc de Μ8118, mais avoit seulement
passe par elle comme par un canal [this
was the ancient blasphemy of a portion
of the Gnostics, see S. Iren. 3. 11. 3.
p. 231 O.T.] : (Γοὴ vient qu'ils luy re-
fusoient le titre de Mere (18 Dieu, et
qu'ils pretendoient qu'on ne pouvoit dire
que 18 corps de J. C. fust tire (selle,
sans mettre une quater-nite en Dieu au
11811 (18 la Trinite ; (18 sorte qu'il est
visible que selon euX, le corps de J. C.
estoit compris dans la Trinite. Ils
disoient aussi que ce corps avoit este
avant Marie etque J . C. l’avoit toujours
eu, ayant toujours este fils de l‘homme,
qu'il l’avoit pris du ciel [S. Cyril in his
Ecumenic Letter to John Archbishop of
Antioch (see 3 Epistles p. 72) says that
some had reported that he himself had
held this very thing]‚ qu’il n'avoit eu
qis-ii descendre en terre avec son corps
qul 'luy estoit uni substantiellement,
qu'ainsi ce corps estoit 11011 seulement

consubstantiel a la divinite, mais aussi
celeste et incree.”

When therefore scyri] insists on
the Word having been made flesh, the
Eastern Bishops thought that while
using S.John the Evangelist's words,
he was pressing the ’γέγονε to mean haila
become, been actually turned into : and
1118 “ One Incarnate Hypostasis of the
W ord ” seemed to them to mean not
Union but the mixture and confusion
of the Apollinarians. Theodoret, in his

objections 10 1118 12 chapters which S.
Cyri] and his Council had drawn up for
Nestorius to sign, does not in general
use language that differs very much from
S. Cyril's own mind 3 but sets out with
the conviction that S. Cyri] was an Apol-
linarian and so reads and interprets the
chapters as really intended to bring in
Apollinarian error secretly by use of
veiled language. Thus in reply to S.
Cyril·s “for she [the blessed Virgin]
hath borne after the flesh the Word
from out of God made flesh’' (chapter
1), Theodoret remarks, „we say that
Hehas not been made flesh by nature
nor was God the Word changed into
flesh, ,‚ „it is plain therefore that the
Form of God was not turned into form
of serva11t2„ in objection to Chapter 2,
„ Superfluous therefore is Personal u-
111011, which as I think he is putting for-
ward instead ofmi.rt11re›:‚, the objection
to chapter 3 ends with the words, „he
who is teaching us mixture by means of
other names:‚, in objection 1ο chapter
5, ‚‚ but that the Word has been made
flesh by any turning, we not only do not
say, but we accuse of impiety them that
say so :‚. the objection to chapter 6
810383, ‚‚ for not by being turned did God
the Word become flesh‚ but assumed flesh
possessed of an intellectual soul;‚‚ in
the objection to chapter 8088111 similarly
the words, „For neither did God the
Word receive transformation [τροπὴν
388 S. James i. 17] nor again did man
lose what he was, and become changed
into the nature of Godz„ the objection
to chapter 10 begins, ,, Not into nature
os flesh was the Unchangeable Nature
turned :‚‚ in the objection to chapter 11
occur the words, ‚‚ for first of all, he
nowhere mentioned flesh endowed with
mind nor confessed that he which was
assumed is perfect man, but everywhere
he says flesh, following the doctrine of
Apolinarius ; next he intersperses in
his words the notion of mixture, infu-
sing it by means of other words.‚‚ Hence
it is clear that Theodoret’s objection was
not to the chapters themselves but to
the chapters in that he approached them
possessed with the notion that S. Cyril
was an Apollinarian and was endeavour-
ing to disseminate their error by dis-
honest use of apparently orthodox lan-
guage.
