and Son, if each have his proper person and mode of be-
ing2 and moreover hypostasis withdrawing unto diverse-
ness, repudiating the reality3 of true union and having utter
irreconcileability with the other? And what is strange
and shews the loathsomeness 4 of his blasphemies, he says
that the names are common, Ι mean Son and Christ and
Lord. And if he say that they are common, i. e., to One
Christ and to others besides Him, his statement would
have probability: but if he ignorantly sever and supposes
that these terms befit the Word by Himself and moreover
him that is forth of a woman, there are again surely and
unmistakeably two christs and sons and lords. For he
said, „The name Christ must one while be put for the
„ Godhead Itself, other while for the Manhood t00, or also
„ for both„ But the community of name 5 will help him
not a whit to conceive of one Christ and Son and Lord
while he severs (even though the hypostases themselves
part not one from another), and the Persons are disjoined
in their own proper diverseness.

For making manifest to us the force of his innate un-
learning he subjoins and says,

„ When therefore the Divine Scripture is about to speak
„ of either the birth of Christ which was forth of the blessed
„ Virgin, or His Death, it is never seen to put God, but

„significant of the two natures, one while of this, other
„ while of that, other while of this and that. As for ex-
„ ample when the Scripture declares to us the Generation
