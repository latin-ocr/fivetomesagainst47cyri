The Greek editions of the council how-
ever agree with Mercator in styling
this extract εἷς δόγμα, but omit the

other siinilarities or re-capitulations are
referred to in margin. The passage
which stands at the head of ᾗ 13 (see
below p. 77) 16 from serm. 2. p. 65 Β61.
and smne of it also in serm. 1. p. 55.
The whole passage as cited here and app
in the Council of Ephesus (see next from the 15th quire3 one of which 16,

words in the title to the other extract,
ending it instead to two citations

note) is given by Mercator with the title,
From the book of Nestorius himself, ont

l volume from which the extracts were

taken for the Council of Ephesus, the
sermon on dogma seems to have nearly
followed that which Mercator gives us
complete pp. 56-70, and which is there
called sermon 2 : for the extracts from
this sermon 2 are extracted from the
15th and 161h quires, see Mercatoris
opera pp. 205, 207, 210 Bal.: while the
two extracts given from the sermon on
Dogma are from the 16th and thh

uires, viz. this one from the 16th
Merc. p. 201, or 17th as Greek edd.)
and the extract at the head of ᾗ 8 below

in part, at the head 0f§ 14, the other is
given by S. Cyri] both there and in his
letter to Aeacius of Melitene written
after the reconcilation with the Eastern
Bishops, Epp. p. 115. l. 5-9.
