such names confesse-dly be, for many are sons by grace
and 90ch and {orde both in heaven and ίη earth, as the Divine-

uttering Paul too writes to us: yet [they are so] as par-
ticipating with Him Who is so by Nature and in imitation

[of Him]. Still the name CHRIsT and its reality will per-
tain in no wise to the bare Word from forth the Father,
conceived of by us as bare [Word] by Himself and apart
from flesh: but if now He be said to have emptied Him-
self and to have come down [to be] in servant’s form and
been made as we by reason of the flesh, He too will be
called by reason of the anointing‚ Christ 3 for not in His
own Nature has the Word being God been Anointed, but
the anointing hath happened to Him in regard to His Hu-
manity. Thus therefore when that has first entered in,
in regard to which the anointing takes place (for His is
the Incarnation whereto belongs the anointing)‚ when
Christ is named by us we will not (according to thy un-
bridled speech) suppose that just a man, severed from the
Word and put apart, has been born of the holy Virgin but
the very Word (as I said) out of God the Father united to

But that the anointing hath happened to God the Word
in respect of the manhood‚ when He became as we, holy
Scripture will prove to us3 for the Divine-uttering Jacob
departing from his father's hearth was hastening on his
way unto Mesopotamia and going to Laban the son of
Bethuel, and having Ziqhz‘ed οη α, certain place on the way
thither he was lodging there and, laying his head on a
stone, he sleeps: and having seen 3 ladder‚ stretching on
high from earth to heaven and angels both ascending and
descending by means of it and the Lord resting thereupon,
he marvelled much at the vision and taking the stone he
set it 11]] as α pilleo· 0⁶71ch pourecl oil upon Hae top of it. Rq-
gard now herein our Lord J esus Christ, the One and only
and truly Son, as a pillared stone. For indeed He is a

1]ιο corneo· and for 1]ιο fowzdczz‘ion of Zion by God the Father.
