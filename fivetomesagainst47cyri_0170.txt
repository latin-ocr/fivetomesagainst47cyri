56 S. J olm tells that Cnfflsr knew lzearts, 9010 the Hom (1ΗοοΤ .·

descending to communicate in blood and flesh), and verily
He is recognized as (1οᾶ 1111011 appearing as Man also.
And a clear demonstration of this are the things that have
been written in the Gospels concerning Him. For the Di-
vine-uttering John said, Now when He was in Jerusalem in
the feast, many believed 111 His Name when they saw the mi-
meles which He was doing), bat Jesus Himself did not trust

H [7728er to them, because He lmew all thiu-qs ancl needed not Ξ
that any one should test‘z'fy of mamsor He knew what was in ,
man : albeit the being able to see the heart of man and to
know its secrets, will not belong to any one (whence should ἶ

it ‘?) of 111011 like us, nor yet to ought other of things made,

but rather to Him Alone Who is said to fashion our lzearts
by Himself. Then how has Emmanuel, being called God, J

been honoured like Moses with the mere title alone, and is
not rather in truth that which He is also said to be? Thus
again does John write of Him,f0r He whom God sent speaketh

derstandest thou then how, albeit beheld a man as we, He
spealcetlz the words of God ? For to God Alone Who 10 by
Nature and truly will pertain as something choice and above
the creature, the being able by a word to achieve what He
will and to render partakers of the Holy Ghost them who
have been justified in faith 1—and one may see that Christ
is in this case. For He said to the leper, I will, be clean„

to the widow's son, Yoanss mavi, z‘o thee say I, Arise: and .

His own Disciples He manifested partakers of the Holy

and been crowned With God-befitting renown be god after J
such sort as was Moses? whose heart knew he? who hath ᾖ
believed on 1110 1101110 ‘? whom hath he justified through faith Ι
