ᾧ 6 tion: is it the union, Ι mean in respect of Person, which wE ‘-
set forth, striving together for the doctrines of the Truth‘?

or is it this which is conceived of as one of juxta· posi· '

tion and pr oximity of any to anything. ⁹ for thus does the 1
God- -inspir ed Seiiptur e take the word. And verily He spake
to the most 110157 Moses, when He was discoursing with him 3
Exod. respecting that olden tabernacle, And thou skalt make fifty
ἔζζὶζίῖω {stelles of 90ch (cml connectss the curiarius one to other with tlte
lb. 3. 1001100. For being five and each having individually the be-
1118 other than the rest, they were connected by the taches.
But not thus do wn say that the union has been νν101181111-,
00 to Christ, for neither as one may be connected withan-² 1
other, either in respect to like mindedness 01· bodily near-
11000, was He too like this, but (as Ι have repeatedly said) l
He made His own the Body which was taken fr om forth ’1
the holy Virgin3 and we say that the Word out of (11οΓ1

Hence if the force of the connection which has been Ξ
spoken of by him, signify the union which we mean, i. e. 1
of Pers,on reasonably will he have said that there is no 1
severance of 0111100111 that He is Christ3 for He is „not Ἰ1
,,0110 and another, 1101· yet son and son, other and other, i

for thus will He be in respect of rank (as THOU sayest) '⁸1
and also of sway, insever able, yea rather the Same. Then ³
how dost thou say that the One and Inseverable is twofold‚ ,
and that not in regard of rank but of nature? for not be-
cause the Word' out of God the Father having taken flesh,
proceeded forth 111011 00 we, will He for this reason be called
also twofold‚ for One and that not without flesh is He Who
is in His proper Nature external to fiesh and body ὃ. For
as, were one to kill a man such as we are, he would not with
