the truth, hath gone again unto what liketh himself and Booxii.8.
saith, „ Therefore is God the Word called Christ also, see-
„ing that He hath His connection with Christ perpetual.
„ And it is not possible for God the lVord to work
„ ought without the manhood, for it hath been accurately
„adjusted unto exact connection, not deification, as the
„ wise ones of the neo-dogmatists say. „ When therefore
he says that the Word from forth God the Father has been
separately called Christ, as having connection with Christ,
i. e., with another, how has he not idly prated in saying
that after the assumption He cannot be so styled sepa-
rately? since not as One is that conceived of by us which
is said to have been 3001ε1011ΐ311γΞ connected with ought
else, for two of a surety will be rightly conceived to be
the things which come together, and not one, itself con-
nected with itself. False speech therefore are his words,
and in another sense are they idle talk: but WE after the
union, though one name God the W0rd‚'00nceive not of
Him apart from His own flesh 3 though one say Christ, we
recognize the lVord Incarnate ¹. What then is the mode
of the connection which you speak of conceived to be? for ζ,
Qay that the human nature has been united Person-

ally with the lVord That sprang forth from God, why (tell

me) do you insult the Divine Flesh ‘? albeit you refuse not

to worship it, while the duty of being worshipped belongs ν
only to the Divine and Ineffable Nature: but 11913011 (10
