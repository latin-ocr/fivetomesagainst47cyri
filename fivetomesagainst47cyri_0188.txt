The 8011100137115111011011111110190ηᾶ to the glory of the FATHER.

every z‘onyue should confess Lomz ‚sesne Christ. And shouldst
thou say t that he was made God by Nature, he hath blas-
phemed openly, saying that the Nature of the Godhead is
generate 3 and if not by Nature but he receive the dignity

¹¹⁷⁶ of gift and from outside and by mere title 9, how is 116 1101

openly saying that we worship him who is not by Nature

ς God? And together with 115 (11 15 like) the gravity1 of

the spirits above too is in error. And the Father Himself
is the beginning and plea to 115 of 111656 things. How then
will He yet find fault with them who have chosen to wor-
ship the creature rather than 1111115611Ἶ ? and why does He
indict and punish those that have erred, if the error have
been by the will of Hinisclf, in exhibiting to 115 as an ob-
ject 01 worship him who is not by Nature God‘?

But since citing here this word, I mean the 0116 before
us, that to Him shall bow every lmec (ind every {onyae shall
confess [0111 Jesug Christ, he (1 know 1101 how minded)
pretermitted what remains and was of necessity added 111
order by 1116 blessed Paul, come 161 115 adding it say this,
for every {on-(sue cmffesses Low] <se-sus Christ to the ylory
(ᾖ Geel the Father. Hence if He be not by Nature God,

εῃ, but 116 says that on account of accidental2 connection, Ι

mean with the Word 0111 of God, he is worshipped both by

' ourselves and by 1116 110157 angels :-—some mode of honour 3

has been invented by the Father, 50 that the creature
should be engodded along with Himself, and to no purpose
has He displeasure against any for having done this: and
if this thing were 10 Η15 honour, how should He not deem
worthy of recompense, praise and glory them who have
01105611 10 do this ‘?

But haply they will say this, How is it any honour to the
Fa-ther that every lmee should bow to Emmanuel?

Because the Word being by Nature God and out of Him,
that is, out of His Essence, has been made flesh, and is
worshipped (as I said) as One and Alone and Truly Son
With His proper Flesh. And the Father is glorified as God,

t φὴς. The Roman editors conjectured φησὶν, he says, to avoid the sudden
change ospersou.
