of their differenoe will speed apart : hence two are they
confessedly.

But tell me who ask, what is it that severs the natures
one from another and what will be the mode of their dif- '

by nature is man or the manhood, another God 01· the God- ’
head: and the one exalted incomparably above the other, =3
and it as much inferior as is inan less than God. How j
then (tell mo) dost thou deem right to honour With one
worship things of so unlike nature and parted, as regards ¹
their mode of being, by ineomparable differences? For
would you, if you put about a horse a man's glory, be
doing anything praiseworthy‘? would you not rather be
insulting the superior, dragging down the better nature ,
into dishonour‘?
