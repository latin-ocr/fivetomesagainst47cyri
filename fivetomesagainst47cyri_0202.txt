Virgin as though another Christ than the Word That is out
of God the Father, says that he became the Apostle and hiqlz,

what oonduoe unto piety when he says, „ If God be the
,, offer-er, there is none to whom offering is made, for what

„ is there worthy of Godhead that as though less It should
„ make offering to the greater? ,‚ Now if there were any
who were oontending and saying that He That is truly
Word out of God the Father had been appointed to office
of priesthood even before the Incarnation and were in the
measure of ministry and were for this reason to be called
High Priest and Apostle, he would have given a wise re-
buke³‚ and one would say that his argument hereon had
been made in season. For not in laok of priests is the
Nature That rules all, that Himself should minister therein.
But since the Only-Begotten‚ being God by Nature and

made an High Priest, let not the expres-
sion be referred to His Being but to the
quality of affairs. For Paul too being
