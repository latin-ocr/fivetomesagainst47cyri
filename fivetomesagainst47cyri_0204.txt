Hath the Godhead then (tell me) become the acquisition 3

by Nature and in truth and to be rich in the excellence
of ‘the Essence that is above all and Supreme ? Away with
the ill- counsel‚ o man, for none of those accounted among

things geneiate may acquire and have as his own the
Natuie of Godhead: His own was the Body of the Word
and as one therewith God and Christ and Son and. Lord
hath the creation worshipped, and the Heavens (10 praise
and we with them. For as the Prophet saith, His Good-
11033 4 covered 1710 Heswens and of His Praise was the earth
full, not as though a man gat Godhead (for how or whence
could he ΣΡ) but that the Word out of God the Father had
come into possession 5 of flesh of man. But be it that he
who was taken 01ιὲ of 111011 was owner of Godhead (as seems

ccranen good to yourseffl, how is he ordained in 11111193 to God-

ward, i. 6., as High Priest‘? will he therefore bare of the
Godhead which he gat, minister in the Priest's office to
God, or already having it as his own ⁴? for this and nought
else will the saying that he gat it signify. But if bare of
it, he gat it not3 if having it as his own, Godheadm will
surely minister in the Priest's office to God. Why then do
you wander distractedly 6 611(1 J umble all together and blush

α α - 1101, stamping with false mark 7 the tradition of the Faith‘?

The Word out of God the Father hath cogent reason
even though He be said to execute the Priest's Office be-
fore the Father 3 for He has been styled Priest not apart
from flesh, but made (as Ι 661(1) 66 we, 10 whom the glory
of the priesthood is accounted an honour.

In another way too it is not hard 10 666 11161 11 is the
absurdest possible thing and replete with much folly 10
say that he who was taken out of men and orclainecl 111110
Gal-ward, is possessor of Godhead 3 for if he were taken
by God, how possessed he the Nature Which took him ’.Ρ
for that which is taken will rather belong to him who took
it, as a possession, not that which is taken be the posses-
