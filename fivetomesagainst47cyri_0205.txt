Possessed and Possessor not identicccl teo-ms. 9]

sor. As for example, A man has become the possessor Booxifii.
of wealth, or again of skill unto anything : is it not plain
to all that he will not himself be the possession of wealth
or again of the skill that accrued to him, but rather the
possessor of what he has gotten? but this is I think in no
way doubtful.

Hence if 011 enquiring into the mode of the Incarnation
of the Only-Begotten‚ we find that man became God as
coming into possession 8of Godhead‚ let him be called (after
you1 phrase) possessor of Godhead, for his hath the God- ῗΓὼοςέ ‹er
head become. But if the Word being God came into ψρο ἡ
possessionn of the seed of Aba (tham, and being 111 the form Heb ii
of the Father, hath become Man, receiving the sew’vant s 16
form, how would one not be distraught, if he chose to say7 Ρὶιί-1 ii.
that that which was taken possessed the Nature That 80- ’

quired it and hath not rather become the very own of Him
Who took it?

But that he carries round the force of his own words
and inventions and moreover the very name of high Priest-
hood in unlearned wise unto a mere man born from forth
a woman, bearing it away from the Only-Begotten and
Word That is out of the Father, he will make manifest by
what follows too τ for he has written again 011 this wise:
