AG. nnsw. every body (I suppose) unhesitatingly say, that all who are
on the earth are conformed one to another and to Christ
Himself, in so far as He is conceived of as man, Who is
both Man and with us‘? what formation then unto Christ
was it that was sought for in them? or how are WE trans-

of Christ. What then first is the image of our forefather?
proneness to sin, beeomin g under death and decay. What
again that of the heavenly‘? being in no wise o'ercome of

passione, not knowing to transgress, not being subject to
death and deeay, holiness, righteousness‚ and whatever are

akin to and like these. But these (I suppose) will befit

the Divine and Untaint Nature to possess: for superior

to both sin and deoay is Holiness and Righteousness.

Herein does the Word out of God the Father restore us
2S.Pet.i. too, rendering us partakers of His own Divine Nature
through the Spirit.
