100 The Baptisz‘ witness—es to a Man, yet Prior:

common man, not considering that it will full surely shevv
Him to have been older and pre-existent to His own Birth, if
He were at all of yesterdcty, which is indicative of time past.
That not one is He that is μείω-εἶαρ] (md to-day‚ J esus Christ,
another He Who saith, before Abraham ‘toas Ι am, but One
and 13116 Same by a true Union, the Word having been made
Man as we and having preserved to His own Nature, even
when He was made man, the being without beginning in
time, one may see and that without trouble, in 13116 God-
inspired Scripture. For as the blessed Evangelist John
saith of Christ 13116 Saviour of us all, Jolzsn bem-eth witness
of Him ancl bath criecz sayt'ozy, He Tltat comeflz after me has·
been mades before me, sor He was before me, and again,
The neceb 'clary lac looketh αὖ Jeszts cominq unio him and saith,
Beholcl the Lamb of God lVlzz'ch tatem away tlte sin of
the world, This ‘is He of W hom I said, After me cometh a
Man Which has been made before me, for He was before me.
Thou 566513 then and that very clearly the Divine-uttering
Baptista calling J esus ce Man and coming] after, as being late-
born and after him, yet preceding him and pre-existing,
for this, I deem, the words, for He zoas before me and has

been made before. me, mean. How then if He is a Man, is

⁵ γέγονεν, has been made, or has be· that He is Word‚ the second place as
come. S.Cyrilin his commentaryappears to the flesh, even though out of His
to understand the word in the sense of, fulness have all the saints partaken: for
has surpassedmy measure and come to he alone full is the Godhead as It saith
before me, though I rwas before Him in
time,· the latter wordsfor He was before
me, i.e. as God, giving the reason of His

through the voice of Isaiah [the allusion
is to Isaiah i. 11, πλήρης εἶμί which S.
Cyril read separately from the words

surpassing John the Baptist's measure

and calling. See S. Cyril 011 S. John i.

15, pp. 98, 99: pp. 113 sqq. O.T.

to flesh, and in the habit of communi-

‘¹ John says of Christ, ‘ He who cometh
after me, i. e. He who is manifested
after me‚' Whom he himself heralded,
‘ has been made before me‚' i. e. pre-
ceding in glory: for He was first in
Being also as God. How then is he who
is after Him before Him in time? be-
cause the Word was God and has been
made flesh, having the precedence in

following, as his citations beginning with
the words following in Gla h. 19 a,
on S. John 140 b shew]: to t Alone
will pertain rendering others partakers
of Itself out of Its own fulness. This
Christ hath done. There is therefore
One Son and Lord, the Word out of God
made flesh, the same God alike and
Man. The following will have the
same meaning: This is He of whom I
said, After me cometlz a man wlco has been
‘made before me for He was prior to me.
For lo calling Him a man and coming
after, he says that He is first (πρῶτον)
as God. For in tlte beginning was the
lVord and the Word was God.’¹ de recta
