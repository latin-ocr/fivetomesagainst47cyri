CHRIST witnesses to Himself. 101

He conceived of as pre-existing and is said to be before Booxiii.3‚
him who had the start of Him in time and had his birth in
the fiesh older than His? For if this were said of a man
like us, every body would (I suppose) be at aloss to defend
it, but in regard to Christ the Saviour of us all, there is no
difficulty. For He Who is out of God makes His own the
birth of His own fiesh, yet is He not ignorant that He is
Maker of the worlds and hath pre-existence as God, and
