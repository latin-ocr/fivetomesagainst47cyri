102 Son FATHER'S [maye as Gon, as Man like us.

nature have become the very own of the Word, those again
of the Word Himself, the very own of the human nature:
for thus is oonoeived os One Christ and Son and Lord.

But since this innovat0r2 has added that „like to His
,‚ brethren in all thifnqs is He Who assumed brotherhood of

„human 50111 and flesh, not He Who saith, He that bath seen
„ Me ham seen the Fatlier, ,‚ come now let us again consider
as we can what it is which he here saith. For that the
Son is the Imago and Impress 3 of God the Father, he too
hath confessed ε who again ,‚ He is Who of human 50111 and
,‚ body assumed brotherhood, „ i. e., with us, let him come
for-ward and teach 3 for no one would say that a man like
us, such as (for example) Barnabas or Paul or any other
of those who are reckoned among men, would be said to
take brotherhood of human 50111 01101 body, as though he
were ought else than this, and so took it, but he is so

ve rather in being what he is. Not one therefore who is man

could be conceived as taking the being what he is, as
though it were other than he: but it will beseem rather
the Word which sprang forth of God, having no rank

υς among us in regard to the count4 of His own Nature, to

take „ brotherhood of human 50111 and body ,‚ with us.
And the word of the truth eontends on our side and the
tradition of the undefiled Faith. It holds then that God
the Word in the Form of God the Father has been made our
Brother in all things, taking ‚, brotherhood of human 50111
,, and body, „ and will not speak falsely in saying, He that
1111171, seen Me ham seen 1710 Ραΐῖιθν. For if any among 115
had fallen into suoh unlearning in his ideas as to suppose
that God the Father Himself Which 15 in Heaven must
needs come down, even to the having likeness with. us (Ι
1110011 bodily); he might well have feared lest that when
Christ sayS, He that 710111 seen Me laath seen the Father, he
might be imagining that He too out of Whom He is, was in
form as we, and in fashion of body. But since when He
was made man, He preserved the being God, and holdeth
the Beauty of His own Nature untarnished5, I would no
