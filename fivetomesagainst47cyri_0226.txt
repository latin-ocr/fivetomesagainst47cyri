He hath been emptied g
therefore and hath abased Himself by descent into the in-
ferior. How therefore did He yet advance unto dignity
when made an High Priest‘? Remember again thine own
words, for thus thou saidst a little above, „ If the Godhead.
„ be High Priest, who is He who is served by the ministr-y
„of the High Priesthood? if He Who offereth be God,
„there is none to whom the offering is made, for what is
„ there worthy of Godhead that as inferior It should make
„ offering to a greater ? „ Stand now at least to your own
words 3 but this you cannot dc, for you will be borne about
(so to say) by every wind, and perceive not that you are
being driven about, one while springing off from those into
these, other while again from these into those, and in no
wise are you afraid of What Paul saith, For zf what I dc-
stroyecl this I baim aqam, I make myself a trunsqressor.

But you will perhaps say, Affirming that the Word out
of God the Father is everywhere One Christ and Son and
Lord, with His own Flesh, how sayest thou now that He
has been set forth as an High Priest and Apostle? dost
thou not in so saying insult the Supreme Dignity of His
Divine Glory ?

Because, good Sir, (shall I say) the Only Begotten Word Ἰ
of God has been made man and in the measures of the hu-
man ‘na-ture, the fact of Priesthood will not unbefit Him,
and moreover the saying that He has been sent, for He cles-
pisecl the slmme, as the Divine-uttering Paul writes, and

g Sotoo against the Arians who affirm-
ed that the Son was exalted because
man, S. Cyril, following S. Athanasius,
says, “ And what accession os honour has
there been to Him Who is in the form of
God, yet has put on the servant's form?
how will H e not rather with reason seem to

and dwelling in high places, He is said to
be exalted, whither (I pray) after the

Nature of God will that

have been minished Who left the greater
and took up the less? Being God He hath
been made man in order to find—what re-
ward? or how was He glorified Who hath
descended from glory to dishonour? how
hath He been made high Who disregard-
ing the Dignity of Godhead came down
even unto inanhood'? how hath He Who
came down, been made above? what ad-
vance hath abasenient? what betternient
He Who from what is better hath come
into the inferior? If, God Most High,

to be exalted, what was the need of the
coming down? if He therefore abased
Himself in order to be exasted, what
was the need of the abasement? how
is not he unwise who seeks with toil
what he could have without toil Ἰ how re-
ceived He tlte Name which is above
every name, Who was ever worshipped
