taining to the Economy, consider the emptying, the de-
scent unto the servant's form. For we say not that the
Word of God advanced and hastened unto dignity, if He
have been styled our High Priest, but rather that He de-
scended herein too unto emptiness. Since how has He
been emptied and is He said to have been abased, albeit He
possesseth unchangeableness and is in Form and Equality
in everything with His Father? how too advanced He by
little and little and this (as thyself sayest) unto the dignity
of the High Priesthood‘? what sort of growth received He
hereunto? If then it were a bodily 0116, Ι 13111 ask again,

Doth bodily growth lead up to the glory of the Priesthood: ’

and grace that are inherent of Nature. What sort of

growth then will He admit of, 331 thom are all the trea- Col. ii. 3.

sures of wisdom, Who 13 with God the Father Co-giver of
the grace from above? how then is He said to advance? it
is, Ι deam, by God the Word ‹zo-measuring with the in-
crease and stature of His own Body, the manifestation of
the most God-befitting goods that are in Him. For let us
consider that although He has been made Man as we, He

was zealous to lie hid at the first, and administered by little
