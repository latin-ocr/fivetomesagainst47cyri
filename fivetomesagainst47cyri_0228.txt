h In S. Cyril’s very famous lssth
Paschal homily written at the beginning
of previous year, A.D. 430, and cited by
Andrew of Samosata in his objection to
S. Cyril’s fourth chapter and more fully
by S. Cyri] in his repl to that objection
p. 172 e, he says, “ An though thou hear
that Jesus was progressing in stature (md
wisdom and grace, deem not that the
Word of God became wise by accession
but rather remember the Divine Paul
writing on this wise, Christ God's Power
and God's Wisdom: nor dare idly to say
that we shall allot to the man the regress
in stature and wisdom and grace for this
I ween is nought else than to sever into
two the One Christ), but (as I said be-
fore) the Son being Eternal‚ is in the
last times of the world said to have been
declared Son qs God (Rom. i. 4), Eco-
nomically making His own the birth of
His proper flesh : so too being the
Wisdom of Him Who begat Him, He is
said to progress in wisdom albeit All-
Perfect as God, reasonably receiving into
Himself the properties of the human
nature 011 account of the completeness of
the union (διὰ τὴν εἷς ἄκρον ἕνωσιν).”
Pasch. Hom. p. 230 a b. Before this
date S. Cyn‘l had said, ‘⁴ And as for our
sakes He abased Himseff, so too for our
sakes He admits progr-ess, in order that
WE again in Him might advance impis-
dom who of old were made beasts by
reason of sin, might advauce in favour
too, who of old have been hated because
of the transgression in Adam. For all
of ours for our sakes did Christ take
into Himself that He might transform

an things unto the better and might be-
come the beginning of every good to the
race of man.” Thes. cap. 28
In a treatise written at about t e same
date as the Books against Nestorius, S.
Cyri] says, ‘⁴ For the mode and plan of
the economy with flesh knows that He
is both as we and above us3 surpassing.
the measure of the creation as God, and
(so to speak) inferior to Himself in that
He is man. For where is the abasement
which He voluntarily underwent‚ if He
refuse what is human? Yet notin these
is the nature of the Word conceived to
lie, but He rather makes them His own
together with His own flesh, just as He
does hunger and thirst and the being said
to be wearied with the Journey. When
then thou hearest, The little (me waaed
(md was stre7zgthened,filled with wisdom,
admit in reply the my ster of the economy
with flesh. For that e was God in
flesh, the blessed Evangelist wil] himself
assure, saying‚ the grace of God was οη it.
For not as though He had grace from
another God is He said to have the grace
of God, butbecause the little one had grace
which beseems God. For the Word was
and is God even when He is seen in flesh,
i.e. man like us. And if He be said to
have grace 01· to advcmce in favour
( grace) with both God and men, it is not a
whit incongruous, if even the Father
Himself acce ted the economy and the
Son making 1ἶΙὶ5 own what pertains to
fiesh because of what alike befits the
mystery and is serviceable.” de recta fide
