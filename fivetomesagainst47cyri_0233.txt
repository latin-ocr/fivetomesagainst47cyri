the God-inspired Scripture, which says One Lord Jesus
Christ and does not put apart Him Who is out of the seed
of Abraham and the Word out of God the Father. And
besides one must consider this too: for one thing indeed
is Godhead, another, manhood like ourS, according to the
inherent nature of things 3 but by coalescence unto true
union, One Christ out of both, as we have full often said.
But when the hypostases, 65 YOU say, have been severed'into
two and are conceived of as existing separately and apart‚
how will there be a coalescence in one Person, except one

be conceived of as the property 5 of the other: just as of a ⁵

man's soul his body will be conceived of as the property,
albeit of other nature than it, for not the same things are
soul and body?

But (one may perchance say) how is the Holy and Ador-
able Trinity distinguished into Three Hypostases, yet issues
in One Nature of Godhead‘? Because (Ι would say) the
identity of Essence following of necessity upon the differ-
ence of . . . . k, carries up the mind of believers unto One
