Man, and have been made so of a truth. What then didst
thou learn, and say that the Father co-seated with Himself
the manhood that was assumed, and not rather that there
sitteth on the Throne of His proper Godhead, in the
Good-Pleasure of God the Father, the Word That sprang
Ἴ from Him, when made Man too: in order that His Hu-
man Nature be not conceived and spoken of by us as
something other than He, albeit the union that 13 of tr uth 8⁸ η ἣςκατὰ
shews us 2³‘chat Ηο 13 0110 and that His Flesh is not alien ἑὲιῖἒῖζῗζ

In this too thou wilt therefore be caught speaking falsely
and 111 110 slight degree erling from fit ieasoning. And if
to say that the WVord has been made Flesh 13 nought else}5 pp 8,
than that He being 111 the Excellence of Godhead and35
abiding what He was, hath become Man, what glory from
without will He be in need of, Himself the Lord of Glory‘?
ζ For confessedly was He being glorified, the Spirit working see οη
Divine signs3 yet not as a God-clad man, gaining this gfff-5¹4²&
thing from an alien and superior Nature, even as do WB, sq.
but rather as using of His own Spirit: for He was God by
Nature and not alien to Him is His Spirit. Hence we say
that not from without nor by adoption has the operation
of the Spirit been given to Him, even as unto us, or to
he holy Apostles: for to them hath Christ given authority >81:34³st

’1 nd an evident demonstration of this will be His being παρ
