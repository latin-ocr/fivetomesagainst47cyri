*The Mouth of God the Father he says is the Word That is

0111 of Him, by Whose Spirit the things made through Him,

are stablished in being. I have now therefore said that

he brings down to nothing the Mystery of Godliness, which
slias been marvelled at by the holy Angels themselves too,

and reoking nought of the dogmas that pertain unto truth,

he makes light of them saying, ,‚ Wilt thou another opera-

conoeiving that this is nought else save only the being
made man as we, and being born after the fiesh of a woman,
because He hath also been made with us under the Law,
Who as Grod is above the Law.

But since (as I have already full often said) his aim is
to undo the Truth‚ therefore he alone (and that strenu-
