132. lucarum-tion 1ἰοὺ Indwelling. The SON Gon ancl Man,

and brandishes arms againsb 13110 Ineffable glory, and what]
he alone bhinks, endeavours 130 bring in seorebly as a kind
of rubbish4 upon the ohurohes of God: for he maintains
than 'ohe Inoarnabion is indwelling, and nob rather bha‘o 13110
Word oub'of God partook like us of blood and flesh, 31100113
the Word harh indwelb and indwells yeb in all ‘ohe saints,
101113 1135 once been madeas we, and has parbaken Personally
in a single flesh, wherein He is believed 1101311 130 113νο died
and to have risen for us : for of His own will He suffered
in 13110 flesh.

But 1311313 to no purpose is he flinging 31001113 words, and
reoking little of the absurdity of his language, says 1311313
Christ was ennobled by signs bhrough 13110 Spirit, the words
which have been just cited, sufficiently (as I think) shewed:
but leb us examine, if you please, his other words. ,The
, Father (he says) commended 3 , whab then commended
here is, I cannot] understand: for the word is oonfessedly
a word of ‘che markeb and 13110 mob, and replete with oom-
monplaoe triokery ‘¹ 3 bun I suppose 1311313 110 wanted to
indicate, 3οὑ forth, for example, or, ham witnessed to. How
‘chen (tell me) did 13110 Fabher commend? did He exhibitu
one 00111113οἃ worthy of Divine lndwelling? or was ib nob
this 313 311, 101113 rather His own Son made man, yet abiding
even in Flesh, wha‘o He was and is and shall be, i. e. God ’.Ρ
For Jesus Christ W'lzo wrm vester-clay and vio-clay ‘is the Same
evenfor ever.

Come 1311011, leb us examine whab is spoken of Him.
What says 13110 Evangelisb ? And John bare record, sayiozy,
I have seen the Spirae clescend‘iny from Heaveoz like a dove,
. . . . eancl abidinq upon Him, This is He That baptizem
with tlte Holgs Ghost .- cmd I have seen and testffied that This
is the Son of Orod. For our Lord J esus Chrisb was aboub
to sanotify eoonomioally the Jordan, and deigned with us

d ἀγοραῖα τε καὶ ἆ-γυρτώδης καὶ τερ- that the omissionis a slip ofsome tran-
θρείας ἰδιωτικῆς ἀνάμεστος seriber. The omission seems to indicate

θ Thus the MS„ omitting the inter· that as in other places so here too
mediate part, ver. 32 and most of 33. S. Cyril readfrom Hecwen in verse 33
Omissions of this sort are not un· also and so that the omission took
common, even in good MSS„ while the place through the eye of the scribe wan-
frequent citation of these verses by dering from the words from heaven in
S. Cyril, together with the sense, shew verse 32 to those same words in verse 33.
