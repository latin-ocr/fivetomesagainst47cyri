sinful mind and one far removed from what is fit (for He
is Consubstantial with God the Father‚ and moreover with
the Son Himself and is believed to be God and out of
God) : but I think that we should, letting this be for the
present, examine the words before us and with all atten-
tion see whither they look. For says he ‚‚ Doing a greater
‚, insult against Him (i. 6., the Word out of God the Father)
„ and severing from the Divine Nature the Spirit Which
„formed His Human Nature. ,, Whose Human Nature,
most excellent sir, sayest thou has been formed through the
Spirit? albeit thou hadst but now made disoourse to us
about the Only-Begotten Himself Who was begotten In-

to the devils through Him. But if it seem good to thee to 1
shew that they who sever are unimplicated in charges of ⁴
impiety, how didst thou just now call them to us 111501611ὺὶΡ
and how dost thou not peroeive that thou art numbering ³
thyself with them, if thou sayest that the Word out of
God the Father united to flesh, needed just like any of ἵ
