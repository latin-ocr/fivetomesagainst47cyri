Thou sayest therefore that the flesh alone has been sent, ξ 4
and affirmest that it it is which is seen z 113 therefore suffices
also alone by itself to quicken that which is tyrannizedby
death. Why then do the God-inspired Scriptures tell a

Word out of God the Father was made Flesh? for what ggfsgeps
need at all would there be of the Word, if the human nature
sufficeth for 113, even though conceived of alone and by it-
self, so as to be able to bring to nought death and to undo
the might of decay‘? and if it is as you suppose and choose
to think, not God the YVord Who has been sent through
being made as we, but the flesh alone which is seen has
