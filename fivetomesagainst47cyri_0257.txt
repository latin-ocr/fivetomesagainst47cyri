Β S.Cyril in his great Letter to the
monks which Nestorius had seen (see
above p. 20 note l) and was apparently
contradicting had said, ‘⁶ And the Di-
vine-uttering Paul will assure us, say-
ing, But when the salness of time came
God seutfortlz His Son made ofa woman
made under the law, in order to redeem
them that were under the law, in order
that WE might recover the adoption. Who
then is He who is sent, made (as he said)
under the law and of a woman, save
He Who 15 above laws as God? but
since He has been called man, made
under the Law too, z'n order to be z‘n all
things likened to His brethren ?'’ Ep. 1
to the monks, . 13 b. And in his 16111
Paschal homi y, “For as the Divine-
uttering Paul writes, God sentfortla His
SON made ofa woman made under tlze
law. For we do not say that the Word
of God came down into a man born
through woman, in just the same way as
He was in the‘Prophets ; but rather we
shall crown with right approval J ohn’s
voice clearly and truly saying, And the
JV ord was made fleslz aud taber-meleti
among us. And we shall conceive that
the Word has been made fiesh, partici-
ating in flesh and blood; and this in
ike way with those who are in blood and
flesh, ourselves.” Ρ. 227 d e. Nestorius'
object-ion to the idea of Sent anyhow re-
ferring to Gon the Wom) appears in his
objections on pp. 48, 51, 52, 84 as well as

in the present section. To it we owe S.
il’s magnificent teaching here of the
B essings given us in and by the Holy
Eucharist: for to the verse specially in
controversy, S. John vi. 57, Nestorius
adds the preceding ver. 56, with a view
to the argument he draws from the word
flesh, and S. Cyril in repl ing gives the
full teaching of the Catho ic Church on
the subject both of the Eucharist, and of
the sending. S. Cyril meets Nestorius'
teaching not only here but (on the Holy
Eucharist) in his great Letter (3 Epi-
stles p. 65 and chapter 11, p. 69) and the
Explanation of chapter 11, p.156 0 d.
But in his defence of his chapter 11
against the attack of the Eastern Bishops,
S. Cyri] cites in full this passage of
Nestorius and (after alluding to the pre-
sent treatise in the words that he has al-
ready made a long treatise in answer to
Nestorius) proceeds, “ What it is he
wants to understand, in saying that it is
not God the Word Incarnate and made
Man that has been sent, but putting se-
verally and apart (as he says) ‚, the *visi-
ble, „ Ι cannot say, yea rather his soph-
ism is now evident‚ for he undoes the
plan of the union in order that Christ's
Body may be found to be 6 common
body, no longer in truth the ‘ proper
Bffd *of Him who is mighty to quicken
a t in s.’

“ Forg petty confessedly to God the
Word are all human things, but since
He deigned for our sakes to endure the
