that „the visible, ‚‚ to whom alone he
hath allotted the fact of being sent, is
some other son and christ than the Word
out of God, exhibit our mystery as can-
nibalism, in unholy wise bringing round
the mind of believers to feeble notions
and essaying to subject to human reason-
ings what are apprehended by unques-
tioning saith alone? for not because the
Nature of the Godhead is not eaten, will
one therefore say that the holy Body of
Christ is common : but it is needful to
know (as we said before) that it is the
Proper Body of the Word which quick-
eneth all things, and since it is the Body
of Life it is also life-giving. for through
It does the SoN infuse life into our
mortal bodies and undoes the master-y
of death: and the Hom* SP1R1'1' of
Christ quickeneth us in equal wise;
sor it is the SJirit that quielwrwlh. ac-
cording to the caviour's own voice.'' Def.
cap. 11 adv, orient. p. 193 b c d e. So
again in S. Cyril's Letter to the Em-
peror de recta fide (which Nestorius is
very likely to have seen though probably
not sent so soon as this) S.Cyril cites
the text and sayS, “Yet how is it not
true to say that the flesh hath come not
out of heaven, but was out of the Virgin
according to the Scriptures ¹? yet is not
the Word caten, but He is seen in thou-
sand ways gathering both into One [uni-
ting] the properties of the natures by
an economic coming together (σύμβα-
σιν)” p. 35 d 6. When S. Cyril repub-
lished this treatise in a revised form, he
concluded this extract, ‘⁶ gathering both
into One and as it were immingling (ἀνα-
κιρνὰς) the properties of the natures.''
). 7 03 a. In his treatise to the Enlpresses
Eudocia the Emperor-’s wife and his
sister Pulcheria. who had been Elnpress
in her Brother's minority), written at the
same time as the treatise to the Emperor,
S. Cyril says, “As the Lim'ng Fatlwr
sent Me both I live because of the Father
(md he that cateth Me he too shall live
because ofMe.. I would gladly ask them
who distinguish into two clu-ists, the One,
Who I pray is He Who has been sent by
God the Father and Who both lives be-
cause of Him and is on that account
Life-giving '2 If therefore it is the Word
who is out of Him, bare and by Himself,
how is He eaten by us in order that we
may live because of Him (for unem-
bodied is the Godhead b Nature) ¹? but
if they say that he that hath been sent
is man alone and by himself, how is he
life-giving because he lives because of
the Father? albeit how are not all we

that are on earth among the living, God
the Father quickening us, if it is true
that ιή Him ‘we live (md move (md are ?
Since therefore we all of us live because
Qf the Father‚ how (I pray) is the body
of one man alone life-giving on this ac-
count and those of the rest have not
rather the same operation, seeing that
we all (as I said) both are and live be-
cause of the Fatker ,7 what then do we
say to this? The Word of God appear-
ing in human form has been called Sent
(apostle) (for He was sent to preach. re-
mission 1¹0 captives (md receneris of sight
to the blind), but He lives because qf'the
Father for He was begotten out of the
Living Father: for it must needs. it
must needs that the SON born of God
the Father Living and Life be full surely
Life by Nature. But since He made
His own the body which was taken out
of the holy Virgin, He rendered it Life-
giving and with reason, for it is the Body
of the Life which quickeneth all things.
Hence we may not sever into two sons
the One Son and Christ and Lord ; since
He 15 the Same, Life as out of the Father,
Life and Living3 Lifegiving through
His own Body too, as Gon made as we
and Incarnate.'' de recta fide to the Em-
presses ξ 40 p. 177 a b c d. ln the
Thesaurus S. Cyril speaks of sending in
reference to either the Eternal Genera-
tion or the temporal Birth for our sakes
(compare S. Aug. on S.John hom. 21
fin. pp. 338 sq. O.T. with homm.. 36,
40, p . 507, 545 O.T.) ‘⁴ The SON says
that e has been sent by the F ather,
either [either is su ›plied from MSS]
after the mode of 0 edience and Incar-
nation (for He emptied Himself taking
servant⁷s form (md became obedient nnio
death), oras out of the sun the light that
is born and emitted from forth it, or out
of the fire its heat‚i11divisib1y and in-
separably permeating to its participa-
tor.'’ Thes. cap. 32 p. 325. In his comm.
on S. John, S. Cyril takes sent as belong-
ing to the Incarnation, p. 424 O.T. The
very Rev. John Burgon B.D. Dean of
Chichester‚ very kindly sent me from
his laboriously constructed Indices of
the New Testament citations of the
Greek Fathers‚ a list of the citations in
S. Cyril’s extant writings of S. John vi.
57. It 15 probable that Nestorius' allu-
sion to S. Cyril’s interpretation of seut,
belongs not to any comment on this verse
but to the meaning as given in his great
Letter to the Monks 3 which lette‘r Nes-
torius elsewhere contradicts.
