,, which do we eat, the Godhead or the fiesh ’.Ρ ,, Perceivest
thou not therefore at length how thy mind is gone ’.Ρ for
the Word of God saying thatHe is 361113, 36)*3, he also that
eateth Me, he too shall live. But WE eat, not consuming the
Godhead (away with the folly) but the Very Flesh of the
WVord Which has been made Life-giving, because it has
been made His Who liveth because of the Father. And
We do not say that by a participation from without ancl
adventitious is the W ord quickened by the Father, but
rather we maintain that He is Life by Nature, for He has
been begotten out of the Father who is Life. For as the
sun' 3 brightness which is sent forth, though it be said (for see Thes.
example) to be bright because of the sender, or of that out ν
of which it comes, yet not of participation hath it the being
bright, but as of natural nobility5 113 weareth the Excellence 5 εὒνενεί·
of him who sent it or flashed it forth : in the same way and ας
manner, I (leem, even though the Son say that He lives
because of the Father, will He bear witness to Himself His
own N oble Birth 6 from forth the Father, and not with the ⁶ εὐγένει-
rest of the creation promiscuously, confess that He 1163 Life av
imparted and from without.

And as the Body of the VVord Himself 13 Life-giving,
'He having made 113 Η13 own by a true union passing under-
standing and language3 so ΠΕ too who partake of His
holy Flesh and Blood, are quickened in 611 respects and
wholly, the Word dwelling in us Divinely through the
Holy Ghost, humanly again through His Holy Flesh and
Precious Blood. The most holy Paul will confirm the
truth of what 1 361(1, writing thus to those in Corinth who
believed in our Lord J esus Christ, I speah· as to wige 111611, {giam

Holy Ghost, we are made one both with Christ Himself
