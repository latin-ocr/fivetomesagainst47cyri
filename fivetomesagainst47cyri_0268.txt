1 Cor. ix.
26.

154 CHRIST says, My Body, for it still remaifns Body.

„ you ⁴? and again giving the cup 01 1110 Mysteries, He said
,, 1101, This is My Godhead Which is being poured forth
„ for you, but This is Μ y Bzood which is being] shecl for you
„sm⁸ the remission of sins. „

That it is therefore an exceeding folly to want to op-
pose oneself to those who are not at all, and to 110 purpose
10 march forth, taking 101 contradiction that which no one
(I suppose) cared either to think or say, how is it not mani-
fest 10 011 ? 10111 0110 chose 10 contend that the ox is not by
nature an horse, nor yet man an horse, whereas no one
would even endure to think or say this 3—how would he
not be laughed at and besides a vain talker, beatinq the air
and figflctinq (cystinst 11111198 uncertain and devising for him-

ve 0011 sweat and toil against what was not there? For I say

that something confessed ought first to be laid down, in
order that then in due order ours may be ranged against

it.

But 101 us come 10 11110 : for if there be any who should ι

dare to say the Word out 01 Grod had been transformed
into the nature of 1110 body, one might very reasonably
object 10 him, that He 011 giving His Body did not rather

say, Take 001 this is My Godhead which is being broken ⁴
for you, and, this is not My Blood but 1011101 My Godhead ἲ

which is being pourcd forth 101 yon. But since the Word
being God made His own 1110 Body born 01 0 woman,
without undergoing any alteration or turning, how must
not He who saith no untruth say, Talae eat this is My Body .?
101 being Life 00 God, He rendered it Life and Life-giving.

Having therefore opened your eyes but 0111110 to the
Truth, you will I suppose charge, yourself against yourself‚
your superfluity 01 1011811080, 011 011 sides stuttering and
unlearnedly arraying against the Doctrines 01 piety this
thy counterfeit and joyless discourse.
