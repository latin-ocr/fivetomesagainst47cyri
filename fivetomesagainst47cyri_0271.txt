Its very Self united to flesh, in order, having laid down
His Life for us, and given to death His own Body for our
sakes economically‚ and then shewn it superior to corrup-
tion through the Resurrection from the dead, to give pledge
130 all who believe on Him that He will raise up us too, and
make us superior to the bonds of death, and little heedful
of the nets of decay. ·

Hence I deem it is that the Divine·uttering Paul too,
makes a matter of much speech and marvel, the love towards
us of God the Father. For he said thus, that shall we say Rom.viii.

He Who was given, for He Alone sprung from the Essence
of God the Father, the Word both out of Him and in Him :

b S. Cyril in his first Letter to the
Monks comments thus on this text:
‘⁴ Then(tell me) how is Hewho is forth of
the holy virgin called God‘s own Son? for
as the own of aman and so of each animal
besides, is that which is born thereos by
nature: thus God’s own will be eonceived
and said to be that which is out of His
Essence. How then has Christ been
called God’s own Son, who has also been

given by God the Father for the salva-
tion and life of all 2 for He was delivered
because of our transaressions, and Him-
Self bare the sins ο many in His Bady
upon the Tree, according to Prophet's
voice. It is evident then, that the fact
of the Union‚ of necessity brought for-
ward, shews that He who is forth of the
holy Virginis God’s own Son.” Eplp. p.
