confessing His Resurrection, knowing that the Same is both
Son before the ages and Man economioally in the last times
and that He suffered in the flesla for our sakes and hath
risen from the dead,

But (I know not how) the advocate of the Jews' unlearn-

„ That therefore the divine Scripture putS, Son, of the
