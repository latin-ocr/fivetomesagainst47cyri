creature and through sin were at enmity with the All-good
God.

But sever-in g again into a pair of 50115 the One Lord ,J esus
Christ, he says after this wise :

„Hear their other testimony also 3 for had they known,
„ they would not have crzzc'z'fied the Lorcl ofqlory. Lo he says
„tlte Lord ofylory, he calls not so the manhood but the
„ Godhead. But this belongs to those who pluck asunder
,‚ the accurate connection, for when thou sayest, This is nob
„ Lord, but the other is, THOU makest Christ a mere
,‚ man. What then dost thou say, 0 heretic in clerical
,‚ form g? is the man too Lord or not? if then he be Lord,
„ the things said agree ¹¹,- if he be not Lord, do nob THOU
‚‚ making Christ amere man, fasten the reproach of iton me. ,‚
Then he says, „ Hear we the blessed Paul openly crying out,
‚‚ Who He is who is crucified. Hear then most plainly the
2, voice, For (says he) He was crufflfied out of weakness, yet ⁴
„ He livetlzf out of the Power (ff God. 1f He were orneifiesl out

τικέ. see exactly the same expression at
the close of serm. 2 in Mercator, ,‚ Si

p. 69 fin. Bal. Itis not clear whom Nes-
torius is addressing as ,‚ heretic ‚‚ and as
havingcalled the Godhead Lord ofglory.
The learned but uncritical J esuit, John
Garnier(see Tillemont'sremarks 111 notes
71, 73, 74, 91 on S. Cyril of Alexandria,
t. xiv, 780, 78], 792 sq. ed. 2) supposes
this to be a reply (Marii Merc. opp. ii.
pp. 29, 30. Par. 1673) to S. Proclus’ fa-
mous homily on the Incarnation (Migne,
Patrol. lxv. 679 sqq.)‚ but I do not
see any special mention of this point
in S. Proclus' Homily. One would
naturally expect S. Cyril to be the per-
son referred to, but besides that S.
Cyril immediately after disclaims the
expression, a List of references to S.
Cyril’s extant citations of] Cor. ii. 8
(generously furnished me by the Dean of
Chichester) do not supply any passage
likely to be referred to by Nestorius.
S. Cyril in his work against the Arians
cites the text in proofthat the Son is not
less than the FATHER. “ Making dis-
6011156 of the princes of this world and
the folly that is in them, he says, For

is Lord ofglory‚ how is He not God by
Nature? how a creature or made, Who
is even hymned by the Seraphin? for

they say that fall is tlte heaven and the ¹

earth of His Glory, and call Him Lord
qf Sabaoth ε for it is clear that of Him
are they saying this if He is Lord ofglory,
as Paul saith.'’ Thes. cap. 32 p· 272 a.
Commenting on the whole assage (1
Cor. ii. 628) in reference to estorian
errors, S. Cyri] says, “If the mystery
of Christ be God's wisdom‚ and it is
preached to the world and if He is not
truly God according to what somehow
pleases some to imagine, and our saith

15 to Himward ς how is the mystery wise s
if it bear away them on the earth from ’

the true knowledge of God and render
the world worshipper of a man 2
it is not SO. the mystery 1s wise for it
brings to God them that have strayed.
Christ therefore is God, He that has been

crucified is rightly called Lord ofglory.'’ μ-

(16 recta fide to the princesseS‚ p. 62 a.
“Therefore the blessed Paul himself

somewhere says of the rulers of this Ι

world, For had they known, they would
not have crzwified the Lord of glory. He
knows then that the Crueified is Lord
qulory.’' de recta fide to the Empwesses,
