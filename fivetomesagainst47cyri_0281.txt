His own Nature3 and does not perceive that he forbids Bo xv ⁰

Him to be confessed Saviour and Redeemer of all, if so be
that he is son and lord other than He, separately and apart,
through whom we have been saved and redeemed through
the precious Cross. And if so be he 106 simply man, and
not rather the Word out of God the F ather appearing in
human form, let 111111 001116, 161 him shew that he is both
in the Form of the Father and in Equality with Him (for
He tlzouqht not the being] &qual with, Gocz a {712'129 to seize)
and moreover that 116 took the form of the servant as at one
time not possessing it,‚and came to be in emptiness, as
possessing fulness in his own nature : for the Divine-utter-
ing Paul says that He Who is in the Form and Equality
with God the Father, was made obedient 111110 Η1111 even
to death, the death of tlzc Oross.

Is not then the absurdity of their notions manifest?
when blessed Paul calls Him that was crucified Lord of
fflory, no one will say, , Η6 15 1101 speaking of 1116 1111111611
,nature but the Godhead., For we confess One Christ
and Son and Lord of Glory, the Word out of God the Father
made man for our sakes and suffering for us in the fleslz,
according to the Scriptures.

But he in 110 5111611 measure blaming, 65 wishing 10 1111101(
asunder the accurate connection (as himself says), 111056
who allot to God the Word the name of Lordship and bear
it away from the human nature z—he falling into forget-
fulness of what he said, is caught plucking asunder into
two the One, and 111116 recking of accurate (according to
him) connection. For he unlearnedly enquires‚ ‚‚ Is the
‚, man too lord 01· not? if then he be lord, the things said
„ harmonize.„ Hence if according 10 thy witless enquiry,
the Word is Lord by Himself and the man lord, two surely
are the lords and sons. The force then of accurate con-
nection will in no wise profit them who have believed that
one ought to conceive of One Christ and Son and Lord
with the Flesh united to Him. For the Person of Im-
manuel being put and brought forward, though one should
say man, we conceive of the Word out of God the Father
