Spirib-elad saying, ΗΘ was crccczfled out of wealcness but ΗΘ
Za'vetlz of the Power of God, undersband 11 piously: for he
says 11161Η6 116111 suffered humanly, 6111611 Η6 116111 6 116-
11116 utterly beyond passion. And so having, He bare with
1116 weak flesh and having suffered (1661511 humanly, He
lived again Divinely, Himself quiokening His own Temple,
as 1116 Mighb of 1116 Ε611161.

And verily when 1116 111116 >was now 61 hand in which He
musta endure 1116 Cross for us, ΗΘ went away ancl prayed
sayinq, Fatlzer zf a be possible, let this cap pass from Me,
bu‘fi added hereto 61 15116 61066 of His Prayer, Nevertlzeless
1101 as Ι will but as THOU. But since He 6110611 Word and
God all-Powerful, 1166 01166 been held 10 be in weakness
like we, He giving 1116 cause of 11116 111061 eoonomioally,
says, The spirit indeed ‘is willinq, the fleslt weak. Consider
therefore how He 1511011 gh Himself lebting go noughb, nor yeb
suffering weakness in His own Nature, permibssed His Flesh
10 go aster 116 own laws, and 11116 thing is said 10 106 Η16,
because His Body is His own. Hence 1116 being weak
according 150 1116 Flesh proved 10 us 11161 Η6 was Man, 1116
1101 enduring (166111 and soaring away deeay from His own
Body 11161 Η6 16 God Who knows 1101 10 106 weak : for He 16
1116 Life and Might of the Father. For 11161 1116 weakness
11616111 unwonted and unwilled by Him m, He made voluntary
in 1116 good-pleasure of God 1116 Father, 150 save all under
Heaven, Himself will 166611 saying‚ F or I have come down
from ΗΘΜ-Θῆ, not z‘o do Mine own Will but the Will os Him

lose 1101711119 but should mise it up at the last day.

Yeb how, if 15116 will of 1116 Ἐ61116Ῑ· 116 good, does 1116
Son say 11161 Η6 1166 Η16 own Wilz, a good one surely, and
011161· 111611 this? For if 11 be 11015 good, how is He any
