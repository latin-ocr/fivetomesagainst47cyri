their souls holden along with their bodies? did they too
become the work of fire and sword? albeit we say that
they [the souls] were apart from their bodies, enduring
nought of such contumelies in their own nature. Will
they therefore (tell me) be for this reason imparticipate of
the crowns, because they have not suffered the things of
the body? But verily the word of truth does not put them
apart from suffering, for they suffered the things of their
own, not those of others' bodies. ‘

Unlearned then is it to want to ask whether the nature
of the Godhead have been betrayed along with the flesh,
or whether It were holden in the meshes of the Jews or
endured the slaughter also: but it is pious to conceive
rather that the Word will surely and entirely make His
own the sufferings that have befallen His own Flesh, but
abode Impassible as God yet not external6 to His suffer-
ing Body q. But he involving in charges of absurdity the
things so economically wronght, and again and again say-
ing that the Nature of the Godhead ought not to be said
by any to have undergone slaughter, unholily arrays the
force of the Mystery about a man by himself 7, and says
that he it is who was crucified and endured death for the
life of the world. For I hear him saying in another ex-
position of his,

„ This is he who was encirclod in the thor-ny Crown, this
‚‚ he who saith, M y Gocl, M y Gocl why foi-sockest Thou Me?
„ this he who endured a three days' death. ,‚

Such things then doth he say, following his own aim,
but WE will shew him a wiser and truer Emmanuel. the
whole world’s Saviour and Redeemer. For 1¹]oe lVord, as
We have full often said, was maele flesh, and making His
own, a Body which knew to suffer contumelies and death,
