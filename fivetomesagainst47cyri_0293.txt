Jnsus ---‚² the WORD made Man. Holy TRINITY has One ceos-Is. 179

vine-uttering Peter announces to us saying‚ This Jesus Goal nom< v. (3.
raised up, we believe that the Word made man is <lesus
Himself. How then will one say that He has been raised
by the Father and exalted by His Right Hand ’.Ρ for Ι think
that this should be clearly set forth to those who cannot
understand, in order that cutting off occasion of stumbling‚
we may set forth the way of truth straight and most un-
errmg.

He gave therefore His own Body to death for a 'little
while: for by the qrczce of God, as Paul saith, He insted death Heb.ii.9.
for every man. Then being Himself the Life—giving Right
Hand and Power of God the Father, He rendered it supe-
rior to decay and death : and of this He gives us assurance

saying to the Jews, Destroy this Temple (md in three (lays S. John ii.
I will mise it up. Understand therefore that Himself pro· 19.
mises to rear His own Temple, albeit God the Father is said

to raise it: for the Son is, as I said, the Life-giving Right

Hand and Power of the Father. So that even though the

Father be said to work the quickening of the Divine Tem-

ple, He hath wrought it through the Son, and though the

Son again be seen to work it, yet not without the Father in

the Spirit. For One is the Nature of Godhead, conceived see above,
of in three several PersonS, and having Its motion and {gallsse
Operation, spiritual I mean and God-befitting, in regard Ξὸἒὲὅὲῗῑῃᾶ
to all things that are done.

The body therefore yielded to the laws of its own nature,

and admitted the taste of death, the Word united thereto
permitting it for profit’ s sake to suffer this ι but was quick-

ened by the Divine power of the Word Personally united to

it. We conceive then of Whole Emmanuel, which is inter· §.oMattln
preted, With us is God, when we hear the Divine-uttering ¹‘ “3'
Peter say, This Jesus Gocz raised up ; and though thou‘
¹ speak of the visible and affixed to the wood, of ,, him who

,‚ was handled by the hands of Thomas, ‚‚ no less do wn con-

ceive of the Word out of God the Father Incarnate, and
confess One and the Same Son. For being Invisible by
Nature He hath become visible‚ because His too was the vi-

Sible Body. And verily the DZivine David sings to uS, Gocl ξς, 1, ρ,
