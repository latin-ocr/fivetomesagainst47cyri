180 The Palpable and Visible, ALMIGHTY Gon.

Amnum. shall come manifestly, our Geel ancl shall not keep silence,
Hah. iii. and moreover the blessed Habacoua Gocl shall come from η
3. 'seman and the Holy One from the deep-eliadecl mountain.
He being also Impalpable is said to have become palpable
by reason of the Body united to Him. And Luke writes,
s.Lukei. Since many essayecl to set forth in order an account of
1’ ²· those thinqs which have been most surely believed among] us,
even as they hamlecl them to ‘as which from the beyinninq
were eye-witnesses ancl ministers of the Worol, and to this
JS.J0hn the wise John saith, That which was from the beqin‘ninq,
ι’ which we have hearcl, which we have seen with oar eyes,
which we look-ed οη ancl our hanols handled, of the Worcl
of Life, aad the Life was manifestecl ancl we have seen ancl
bear witness ancl declara to you the eternal We which was
with the Father ancl was manifestecl to us. Yet had He
not become palpable and visible, as having for His own
a Body which is subject to touch and sight, how had the
all-wise disciples been made eye-witnesses of the Worcl ‚2
how had they both seen, and say that they handled the
l‘Vorsl of Life, Which was with the Father ancl was mani-
festesl to us .? This very Same therefore Which was both
palpable and visible‚ Which was affixed to the wood,
Thomas recognized and did rightly confess to be God and
S.J01m Lord: for he said immediately, My Lorcl ancl my Gocl.
'iiis {gs Then said to him our Lord J esus Christ, Because thou hast
seen Me, thou hast believed, blessecl they which have not seen
and believed. Believed what, tell me? is it not that being
God by Nature, He raised from the dead His own Tem-
ple? yet how could there be any doubt of this ’.Ρ
But this good man, au bui foolishly ashamed of the ‘
words of the disciple, says not, ‘He confessed Him that
‘ He is both Lord and God, the Flo-samm from the deacl ι’
but rather he perverts to his own pleasure the force of
the word and says that he ,‚ began to glorify the wonder-
„working God, saying, My Lorcl ancl ‘my Gocl„, and sub-
joins, „Not addressing as God that which was handled‚
,‚ for not by the touch is the Godhead discerned.„
Blamest thou therefore (tell me) the disciple calling
