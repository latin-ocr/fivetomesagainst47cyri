AAAAAAAA Three are One. If we receive the witness of men, the witness
of God is qreater, for this is the witness of God, because He
hath witnessed concernirzq His 8οη .- he that believeth οη mc
8οη of God heah the witness in himseff, ke that believeth not
Gocl laath made him a liar, because he believed ‘not the testi-
mony which He hath testffied reqardinq His 8οη. And how
God the Fabher habh testified 'no His Son, the Divine-utter-

S.J0hn i. ing John the Baptista will deelare saying‚ And I knew Him

33, Μ’ not, but He That sent me to baptize with water, He said to

me, Upon leom thou skalt see the Spirit descendiny and re-
maining] apen Him, This is He Which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost. And I saw and have testvfied that This is the 8οη of

Gocl. Our Lord J esus Christ therefore is witnessed to
through the Father's Voioe, that He is by Nabure and in
truth His Son, He is witnessed to no less through the
waher and the Blood and the Spiris. For by the holy
waher He purg-eth away the sins of them that believe, He
