Angel's voice too points out that J esus Christ was truly

born of the Holy Virgin: yet we do not say that Jesus
Christ was mere man h, nor do we conceive of God the
Word apart from His human nature but, we say that He

was made One out of both, as God made Man, the Same
begotten Divinely out of the Father as Word, and humanly

out of woman as Man: not as though called 10 0 second see ffbqve

one of them was called Emmanuel. Why? For not yet
had the time come, when He was 10 be with 110, 1. 0., 10
