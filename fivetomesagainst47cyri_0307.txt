Oloscst connection of body 607ch goul, thaz} of Emmanuel lm'gshcr.

Emmanuel, as one reckons that the sonl of man too has with
its own body. For the soul makes its own the things of
the body although in its own nature imparticipate of its
sufferings, both physical and those brought on it from with-
out. For the body is moved to natural desires and the
soul which is in it shares the perception thereos 8 by reason
of the union, but participates in no way, yet thinks that
the achievement of the desire is its own enjoyment. And
even though the body be struck by any or be cut with
steel, it co-grieves‚ its own body suffering, yet will itself
in its own nature suffer nonght of the things infiicted.

Nevertheless above this too do we say that the union is
in the case of Emmanuel. For it were necessary that the
80111 united thereto should grieve along with its own body,
that so, fleeing the disgrace‚ it might submit a tractable
neck to God. But of God 15110 Word, it were absurd to
say that He were co-percipient of the contumelies (for free
from passion is the Godhead and not in our condition), yet
has He been united to fiesh possessed of a reasonable soul,
and when it suffered, He was impassibly in cognizance of
³ what befell it and brought to nought as God the infirmities
of the flesh, yet made them His own as belonging to His
own Body: thus 18 Ηο said both to hunger and be weary
and suffer for us,

Hence the union of the Word with the human nature
may be not unaptly compared with our condition 9. For
as the body 18 of other nature than the soul‚ yet 18 0110 111011
