194 Tgspcs of that Ineffctble Union.

oooooo A produced and said to be of both 3 so too out of the Perfect

KKKKKKK

Person of God the Word, and of 111611110οᾶ perfect in its
own mode, is One Christ, the Same God and Man in the
Same. And the Word (as I said) makes its own the suffer-
ings of Its own Flesh‚ because Its own is the Body and not
another’s: and It sharesl with Its own Flesh the opera-

ε tion of the eod-befimng might uhab is within 1ss ; so than

it should be able both to quicken the dead and to heal
the sick.

But if we must, using examples out of the God-inspired
Scriptum, shew asin type the mode of the union, come
let us say it, as we are able.

Of the coal.

The Prophet Isaiah says, There was sent unto me one of
the Seraphim αηιῖ in his hemel co live 00ch which he took with ἶ
the tonqs from off the altar ancl he said to me, Lo this touched ἲ
{lay lips ancl shall take [11063] thino iniquities ancl pur-93 thy
sins. But we say that the live 0061 fulfils to us ‘the type Ἰ
and image of the Incarnate Word,Who, if He touch our lips,
i. e., when we confess the fait-‚h Him-ward, doth then both
make us pure from every sin and free us from the pris-
tine charges against us. ¹

Natheless one may see in the coal, as in an image, the
Word of God united to the human nature, yet not 1051118Ί
the being· what He is, but rather trans-elementing what He
had taken, or united, unto His own glory and operation.

‘ ἀι “- For as fire having to do with 2 wood and entering into it,
σαν . seizes hold of it, and removes it not from being wood, but

transmutes it rather into the appearance and force of fire,
and inworks 611 its own property therein, and it 15 now
reckoned one with it, so shall you conceive of Christ too. ζ
For God united ineffably with the manhood, hath kept it ζ
what we say that itis, and Himself hath remained what He
was3 but once united, is accounted one with it, making-‚2
His own what is its, and Himself too introducing into it ”
the operation of His own Nature.
