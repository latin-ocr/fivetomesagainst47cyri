Typcs of that Ineffablc Union. 195

That the flesh having a reasonable soul hath become the Body of the 11116111- · ξ 10
bodied Godhead‚ and that by severing them one from another, we shall
wholly and surely undo the plan 3 of the ecomony in Christ. ³ λόγον

In the Song of Songs 0111· Lord J esus Christ Himself has
been introduced to us saying, I am the flower of the plain, Song of
the lily of the vcoll'ies. As then the smell is something un· ἓξὲξ 1·
embodied, for it uses as its own body that wherein it is,
yet is the lily conceived of as one out of both, and the fail-
ing of one utterly destroys the plan4 thereos, for in the⁴>=670v
object is the smell and the object is its body : so shall we
conceive of the Nature of the Godhead in Christ too, that
it sheds forth on the world the savour of His own more
than earthly Excellencej, as in the object His human Nature,
and that the unembodied by Nature became by economic
union all2but embodied also, because It willed to 106 recogni-
zed through the Body 3 for It hath wrought therein things
1 God-befitting. Hence will the Unembodied be rightly con-
1 ceived of as in His own Body, even as in the fiower too,

¹ the object, is the scent, yet both together is called lily.

That the Word being co-brought to true union with the human nature, ᾧ ll
the things united k have remained unconfused.

The holy Tabernacle was rea-red by the will of God in
the wilderness and in it was manifoldly typified Emma-
nuel. The God of all said therefore to the divine Moses,
Amz thou skalt make αη ark of incorruptible wood, two cubits Exod.
ancl a half its Zenqth, and α cubit ancl half its breadtlz ancl {osv 10,
a cubit and a half its heiqht, ancl thou skalt overlay it with,
pure qold, within and without skalt thou overlay it. But
the wood that will not rot will be'a type of the incorrup-
tible Body (for cedar does not rot); gold as matter sur-
passing all others will indicate to us the Excellence of the

Divine Essence.

j “ Being therefore the savem of God whence Himself is, makes known Him
the Father, He will not be of other Es- That begat Him: hence no creature is
sence than He; but as the scent natu· He, seeing that the Father is not.” Thes.
rally and essentially issuing forth from cap. 32, p. 274 d.
fiowers, is indicative of the species which k τὰ ἡνωμένα. substantiae, Lat. αἱ ὑπο-
begat it, thus the Son too, being as it στάσεις, syr.
were a savour of the Father's Essence
