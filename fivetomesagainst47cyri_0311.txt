God in the world. The Gentiles were therefore without §la
God in the world, when they were without Christ 3 but §ficetdefil
when they acknowledged Him to be truly and by Nature ὦ Ρᾶῑῑῃ(-Θ
God, themselves too were acknowledged by Him coufessing 387³de
the faith. And He was received up into ylorll, Divine glory ‚luTinn
that is3 for blessed David singS, G‘ocl is qone up in joy. ¹1¹>¹glxsf555
For He went up verily with Body, not in bare Godhead, 5.
for God was Incarnate.
W'e believe therefore, not in one like us honoured with
Godhead by grace, lest we be caught worshippers of a
man, but rather in the Lord Who appeared in servant’s
form, and Who was truly like us and in human nature, yet
remained God, for God the Word, when He took flesh, laid
not down what He was, but is conceived of the Same God
alike and Man.
Thus is the faith and rightly. But if any say, What
harm if a man like us be conceived of as laying hold on
-Godhead and not God rather be made man? we shall
answer that there are a thousand things which may be
brought to bear against this, and which all but tell us that
we ought firmly to strive against it and not thus to believe.
For come before ought else, let us look at the mode of
¹ the economy with Flesh and throughly investigate the na-
ture of our condition 3 the nature of man was perilled and
was brought down to tffeoeeitreme of ill, condemned to
curse and death and involved in the toils of sin, was stray-
ing and was in darkness, it knew not Him Who is by Na-
ture and truly God, it worshipped the creature more than
the Creator. How then could it be freed from such ills?
Or do we say that it was lawful 6 for it to lay hold on the ⁶ θέμις
Divine Nature, albeit it did not at all know 'what the Dig-
nity of the Supreme Nature is, it which was holden of un-
learning and darkness, and defiled by the soil of sin? how
'was it like that it could mount up to the All-Pure Nature
aud lay hold on glory which none can lay hold of, except he
receive it? For let it be supposed that by knowledge for 7 i. e. 0!
example, and through knowing we say that it lays hold {Zag Na-
