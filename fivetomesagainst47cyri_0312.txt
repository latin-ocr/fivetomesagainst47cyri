scnom cept they hear? But this is not at all to take hold
of Godhead, and to seize the glory that beseems It.
Hence it will be more meet (and reasonably so) to con-
ceive that God the Word through Whom are all things,
ξῑσυγκοι- desit-ing to save that which was lost, by 00-310300111011138
111110 110, lowered Himself to what He was not, in order
that the nature of man too might become what it was not,
eminent in the Dignities of the Divine Supremaoy by
union with Him, and should be rather brought up to what
was above nature, than bring down unto what was alien
from His Nature, the Unchangeable, as God. It behoved
that the Incorruptible should lay hold on the nature subject
to corruption, that He might free it from the corruption, it
behoved that He Who knew not to sin should 100 made
conformal with those who were under sin, that He might
make sin to cease: for as where is light, there surely
darkness will have no work, so where incorruption is pre-
sent, 10 311 necessity that corruption fiee, and that, since
He Who knew not sin hath made His own that which was
under sin, sin should come 10 nought.

But that the word, being God, was made Man, and 11013
rather that Christ was Man deified, I will endeavour 10
shew from 1110 Holy Scriptures also. Blessed Paul says
