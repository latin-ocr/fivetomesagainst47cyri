names also following Him: for all are His, both the first §13.
and those in the last times of the world.

One therefore is He Who both before the Incarnation
was Very God andin the human nature hath remaiued
That He was and is and shall be. We must not then sever
the One Lord J esus Christ into Man separately and into
God separately, but we say that Jesus Christ is One and
the Same, yet knowing the distinction of the Natures and
keeping them unconfused with one another.

When therefore Holy Writ says that in Christ dWelt
all 1110 fidness of 1110 6101111οα11 11011119, 110 do not therefore Col. ii. 9.
say that the Word by Himself dwelt in another, 13110 man
Christ, nor plucking asunder one from another things
united do we conceive of two sons, 101113 11115 rather, that
holy Writ calls by the name Christ sometimes separately
the human nature of the Word of God which He having
35 Η15 own, used 35 3 Temple. And 113 has been written
somewhere of human 501115 3150, Thena 111111 1110011 in lzozcses -Ildon'- 19.

that their 501115 dwell in them, sever one man into two?
yet how is it not wholly without blame ¹¹¹, that in 3 man
should be said to dwell his spirit? so that even though the
form of speech passes through this mode, unable to do above p.
otherwise, it does not beseem that the natures of things 78 ¹¹⁰te Ζ·
are therefore injured, 101113 rather we must conceive that
they hasten 1110 straight way of the truth.

When then any of 1311050 things which do not possess
like nature one with another, are seen brought together above p.
to unity by composition, 31111 the one (for example) is said 41 note c.
to dwell within the other; we must not sunder them into
two, seeing that the concnrrence unto unity is in no wise
injured, even though one of the things united be sepa-
rately called by us what the two together are. For in man
too (as I said) is said to dwell his spirit3 yet both the
spirit separately and likewise the body are called man.
