202 JESUS mala-es His own what belomy to His Manhood.

scnomA And some such thing as this 60111 15116 111051 wise Paul
2 Cor. iv. indicate to us saying, For tlcoztgyh our ontward man pcrish
16. yet ihc imvarsl man is rencwed (lay by (lay. When then
any saith that our inward man dwelleth in our outward
man, he speaks true, yet he 6065 1101 sever the one into
Isa. xxvi. two. The Prophet Isaiah too somewhere saith, By ‘niqlzt
cloes my spirit riso early 111110 Thoe, O Gosl. Is then his
spirit said to rise early to (106, 65 being other than him-
self? albeit how is it not absurd to say any thing of this
kind? Therefore we must know figures of speech, yet not
depart from what is reasonable, but fetch about the force
of the things signified to the aim befitting each.
S. Luke And although J esus be said to advance in asse and wis-
11 qam, (lom ancl 9111661, this will pertain to the economy. For
ἨΜΘ or the Word of God permitted His Humanity to advance by
reason of the habits of its proper nature, and willed as it
above P· Were by little and little to extend the illustriousness of
notelll1 His own Godhead, 6116 along with the age of the Body to
² ‹rvmfa- put out therewith 2 What is Its own 3 so that nought strange
should be seen and terrify any with its overmuch unwonted-
SssJohn ness: while even so they spake, How knoweth this man
letters 11601119 never learned? Therefore bodily 15 1116 111-
crease3 6116 1116 advanoe in grace'and wisdom will befit
the measures of the Human nature: yet we say that the
Word out of God 15 Himself in His own Nature All-Perfect,
not lacking adt-anae, nor 1013110111, nor qrace, but that He
imparts rather to the creature wisdom and grace 6116 1116
things whereby it 15 111 good case.

And though J esus 106 5616. 6150 10 suffer, the suffering
will belong to the economy3 but 15 5616 to be His, and ¹
with all reason, because His too is that which suffered, and ,
He was in the suffering Body, He unknowing to suffer 1

(for He 15 Impassible as God) 3 yet as sar as pertained to
the daring of those who raged against Him, He would

have suffered, if He could have suffered.

Therefore since the Only-Begotten has been made as
we, as often 65 Η6 15 called Man by the God-inspired
Scriptum, considering the economy, let us confess that
even so is He God by Nature.
