senonm says) are the Temples os the Liviny Gocl, and again, Know
{gon vi. ye 7201} that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost
Which is in you Which με have of God ,9 But if they say

that He is Emmanuel, as each one of us has had God in-
dwelling in him, let them confess it openly, that when they

see Him worshipped as well by us as by the Angels, in
Heaven alike and upon earth, they may blush as thinking

ef.1 Tim. otherwise, and ignorant of the drift of the holy Scriptures,
{i'Liike and not having in them the saith which they delivered to
’ us, who from the beyimzinq were eyewitozesses ancl ministers 1
of the Word. . 1
But if they say that He is therefore God and glorified =
as God because the Word of God the Father merely dwelt ¹
in Him, and not because He was made Man, let them]
hear again from us, If to them who had God indwelling{
in them, it suffices that they might therefore be trulyi
gods and adored by all, all are gods and to be adored, for 1
He dwelleth in the holy Angels, and we have Him our- 1
selves too in us through the Spirit3 but this is not enough 1
to shew that they are by nature gods and to be adored who 1
have the Spirit in them. Not therefore for this is Emmanuel 1
God and to be worshipped because the Word of God dwelt ³
in Him as in a mere man, to be considered by himself and 1
apart, but because He was made flesh, i. e. Man, for He 1

remained therefore God who is to be worshipped. 1
