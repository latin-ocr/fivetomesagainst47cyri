§26

212 CHRIST GoD: else incZweZZi-nq ancl man—worship.

therefore, according to the measure beseeming Prophets,
Himself too 130 have said, Thus saith the Low-d ³? But when
He would ordain the things that are above the Law, tak-;
ing to Himself authority befitting a Legislator, He used tc
say, I say to you. ¹

How says He that He is free and not indebted b to God}
It is because He is Son in truth. And if He were ε
God-clad man, would He be also free by Nature? Fo]
God Alone is free and unbound: for He Alone exacts a}
it were tribute from all, and receives from all as fron
debtors due observance 4. And if Christ is the end of th<
Law and the Prophets, yet is a God-clad man, might on‹
not say that the end of the prophetie preachings has brough'

making light of worshipping God, worship a man who half

If therefore He were God-clad man, how partook H.
like as we in flesh and blood ? For if because He indwel
him, this were enough for Him that He should partake o
ours like as we, and if His so participating is the being mad,
man : He indwelt in many saints tooz He was therefor²
not once but full often made man. Why therefore 13 Η
said once in the cml of the world to have appeared to pu*
away sin by the sacrifice of Hi'msclf .? how do the Divin
Scriptures preach to us one Coming of the Word‘? ”

If ⁰ He were a God-clad man, He too (it seems) was mad:
