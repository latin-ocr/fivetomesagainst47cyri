fore say that bare and fieshless souls made their descent
into Egypt, nor again that to soulless bodies and mere flesh
God gave bounteously of His salvation.

As often therefore as we hear that the Word was made
Flesh, let us conceive of man made >out of soul and body(
But the Word being God was made perfect man taking a
body endowed with soul and mind, and having united this
to Himself in truth, as He knows (for thoughts of this kind
are utterly unattainable by our mind),was called son of man.
Yet if one must say somewhat, looking as in a mirror, the
human mind defines that the Word was united to the Body
having a reasonable soul, much as is the soul of man too
to its own body, which is of other nature than it, yet ob-
tains even thus participation and union with the body, so
as to appear not other than it, in that by composition one
living thing is effected out of both, it nevertheless remain-
ing (as Ι mentioned before) in its own nature. Hence we
say that not by mutation or change has the Word of God
been made Man, nor yet that It recked not of being God
(how could it be so ?) but that taking flesh of a woman
and united to it from the womb, He proceeded forth, the
Same, Man and God, for not as casting away the Ineffable
Generation out of God the Father, did He endure that of
a woman, inviting Him to a beginning so to say of being,
but rather permitted to His own Flesh to be called into
being by means of the laws of its own nature, in regard
I mean to the mode of its birth : nevertheless the human
nature hath in Him something special, for He was born of
0 Virgin and hath Alone a mother incognizant of marriage.
And he says that made Flesh He also tabernaeled 111 us, that
through both he might shew that He both was made Man
