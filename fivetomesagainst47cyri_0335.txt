His Body. Hence if He knows that He is Very God, she
who bare Him after the flesh is called Mother of God, and
rightly so: but if He loe not God, as some daringly, yea
rather wickedly, think : leb them deprive the holy Virgin
herself of this name, that she be not called Mother of God.

David.- shall Gor] in very cleecl clwell with men on, earth?
Observe that he marvels ab the Incarnation of the Word,
for ib seemed a thing incredible: for then did He dwell
with men upon the earth When He was made Man. Else
how is this anything special or how worthy of marvel, that
God should nob depart from these things which Himself had
created, cherishing them that is, and holding together the
things which had been already made, creating those which
have nob been yet made? But verily it is a special mir-
acle that God made Man should have dwelb on earth with
men, according to the promises long before given to the

Divine David, For it is written, The Lorcl szvm'e uodo Ps.cxxxii.

of each: in his Thesaurus he had said,
‘⁴ Except the Son were God by Nature,
He would not have been called, With as
is God, which took place when He was
born through a woman, assuming like-
ness with us. Not at all of an angel or
of any other generate being is the word,
Emmanuel, the invention, but the FA-
THER thus named the Son. And the
holy Prophet will be our witness, say-
ing of the Divine Offspring, And they
shall call His nanze that new Nanze which
the Lord shall give Him (Isa. lxii. 2
LXX). For a new name verily to the
Son is Emmanuel, that z's, With usis God.
For before His Presence in the world
with flesh, He was and was called merely
G0d; after the Birth from the Virgin,
no longer merely God, but, with us, i. e.
God made man. Since therefore the
Father calls His own Son God, let them
blush who impiously and unlearnedly

to the Emperor, p. 26 (1. “ Before the
times of the Incarnation no one is found
naming the Word out of God, J esus or
Christ, unless by foreknowledge that
He should be called this in due time
when He also was made flesh. A new
name therefore to Him is the Name
Jews, when He was made man.” de
recta fide to the Prinoesses, p. 120 d.
“ For a new name to the Word is JESUS,
concurrent with the birth of the flesh.
And the Prophet's oraele will support
us, which sayS, And they shall call His
N ame the new name which the Lorcl shall
give Him.” Dial. V. 551 d. ‘⁶ For When
will any shew that the Word was called
Jesus or Christ, save because He was
made man? for He is Jeszzs, because
He saves His people, Christ, because
anointed for our sakes. Theresore not
the Word out of God the Father, as yet
bare before the Incarnation, but made
in flesh does he call both J esus and
Christ: and of H im questionless does he
say that He was yesterdazs and to-daz ‚

The Same too for ener.’' Hom. Pase 1.
