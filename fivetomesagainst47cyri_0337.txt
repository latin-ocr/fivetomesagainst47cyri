of God (as saith blessed Paul) did He by His Body taste Heb.11. 9.
deathfor every man. But since He was by Nature God,

He rose again unto everlasting life. He therefore is known,

Who for us endured the Precious Cross, in the mizlst of

the two living] ereata-res. And Himself says somewhere to

the Jews, When ye have lzfled ap the son of man, then shall S. John
ye know that Ι am. But how, calling Him also God, does viii. 28.
he fore-announce that He shall come from Teman and from
'mount Paran? Teman is interpreted south: for Christ

was manifested, not from northern regionS, but from the

southern J udaea, wherein Bethlehem is.
Since therefore He Who has been named Lord and G0d‚
cometh out of the southern Judea, for He was born in Beth-

lehem, how is not the holy Virgin Mother of God?

tic is the sense of that which is written, for it appears to

hint at the wrestling of the Jews which they used in re-

gard to Christ, well-nigh wrestling with Him, neverthe-

less they were overcome and will themselves implore His

Blessing, if through faith they turn them to Him at the
last times. But note this, it was a man who was wrestling,

and Jacob called him The Face of God: nor that alone,
sor he knew that He is Grod in truth. For I have seen (he
said) Godfaee tofaee ancl my life is preserved. For Em-
