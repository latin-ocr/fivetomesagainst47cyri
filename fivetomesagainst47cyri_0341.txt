His what bcsall His Flesse, yet ONE. 227

How then is He from above and out of Heaven? God the
Word from above and out of the Father, taking flesh from
the holy Virgin and manifesting it as His own, as though see above
He had brought it down from above and out-of Heaven, p.101
said, No man laath ascendecl up into Heaven, save He leat Q. John
vcame down from Heaven, the Son of Man: for He ever m. 13.
allotteth to His own Flesh that which is His own, and once
united to it is accounted one with it.
Yet see, when the one bird is slain, the other is dipped
ζ in his blood, yet died noe. And what is this? The word
lived, even though His Flesh died, and He was participant
⁸ in the Passion, through ownness and union with it. There-
* fore the Same was living, as God, but like as He made
’ Η15 Body His own, so did He receive into Himself in all
’ ownnessl the sufferings too of His Body, Himself suffering ι κατόῖ-
nought in His own Nature. It is therefore helpful and netem
necessary unto profit that in regard to Christ we should
admit the after one 1110117181· and another, as belonging to see head-
0110 and the same person, yet should not permit Him to {ffnzfffic‘
be severed into two sons, albeit the things done 100 said to

be of diverse kind and in no ways harmonizing with one ¹
another.

This is what I mean: we say that God the Word is born
out of a woman after the flesh, albeit 1111115011ἱ give to all to
be born, and call to the birth the things which are not yet

ς 36.

   
 
 
 
 
 
    
  

  
    
  
    
     
  

¹. As is the Heavenly, such too they that
are heavenly, and, No one laath gone up
Ξ into Heaven except He W Ιιο came ont of
Heaven, the Son ⁰f Mans, and whatever
else there is, is to be understood as said,
, because of the union with the Heavenly
(διὰ τὴν πρὸς τὸν οἶίράνιοιι ἕνωσιν).” t. 1
l p' s⁷ ,41151ῗῖ1 {irrtisssssschai homily (Ab.
420, probably almost ten years before 1115
l ooks against Nestorius) had said, ‘⁴ God
the Word was born 011 031111 through

ξ 31110 down from heaven. How then does
.He say that the Son of man came down
but of Heaven Ρ how again does He say
1 1131 Ηο will go up where He was before

before flesh and with flesh confessed by
us· Therefore He says that His flesh
albeit by nature of earth came down
from above and out of Heaven, and will
ascend into Heaven too where z't was be-

fore. For that which is inherent in Him

by Nature He puts about His own flesh
35 being not other than it as regards the
Economic union. And we will not
because of the utter union of things un-
like in their nature, take away the fact
that One is properly the Radiance of
the Father‚ the other again the little
flesh (τὸ σαρκίον) of earth or perfect
man: but even thus distinguishing and
in mere ideas (see above p.,78 note z)
parting the plan of each, we will draw
them in to union again unparted. For
the Word was made flesk, according to
the holy Evangelist, not turned into
flesh.⁷' p. 102 b c d. See also de recta fide
to the Emperor, p. 36 a b.
