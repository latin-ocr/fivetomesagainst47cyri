used the singular number, not permitting Grod and man
130 116 conceived of separately‘? yea rather if one were to
call Emmanuel man, it signifies not bare 111311 (sar from it)
but the Worcl of God united to our nature. As One did
the Divine disciples worship Him, when beholding Him
wondronsly borne on the waters they worshipped sayz'nss,
Truly r Thou art Hm Son os God.

When therefore we say that man is co-worshipped with
God, We have brought in a gross severant-e. For the
word, With, except 113 116 said of one by composition, will
always full surely persuade us to conceive of two. For
like as no one will be said to live with himself nor again
to eat with to pray with and to wall( with himself (for the
with prefixed 130 13116 word introduces a declaration of two
persons): so if one say that the man is co-worshipped
with God, he will without question say two sons and se-
vered one from another: for 13116 plan of union, if 113 be

¹· S. Cyril‘s argument on those words
and truly so, and that Christ Himself

in his Thesaurus, against the Arians who

denied the Son’s Godhead, equally
holds here as to its being no mere man
apart by himself who was walking on
the water. S. Cyril sayS‚ “What then
will they say who contend against the
Truth and follow only their own likings,
when they see the whole choir of the holy
Apostles together worshipping the SON
as God and saying with an oath that
Trnly He is the Son qs God? for if ac-
cording to their unlearning He is one of

the creatures how is He truly Son of

of any, and who has not the own (τὸ

him, be truly 5011. Α1κ1 how if the
disciples made a mistake in saying this,
was the Saviour silent, albeit He did
not disregard them when they made
mistakes? and verily to Peter when on
one occasion he answered not aright, He
says, Get behind Me satan, thou art αη
offence to Me because thou savonrest not
God‘s but man's. But since He was
silent, when called truly the Son quod,
in that He rebuked 1116111 not as mis-
taken‚it is clear that He accepts them

as saying aright. Seeing then that
