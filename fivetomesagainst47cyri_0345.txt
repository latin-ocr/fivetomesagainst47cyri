Some prate concerning the Economy with flesh of the
Only-Begotten and, bringing down to our frail perceptions
the Mystery venera-hle and great and most dear to 1110
Spirits above, whereby also we are saved, pollute the come-

as God He have in ,Η18 own Nature the vinability to suffer ς
11111 putting 08 111011 separately and by himself him that was
born of the holy Virgin, and attributing to him to what
