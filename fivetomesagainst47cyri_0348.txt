WVorcl Was made flesh3 or if they think that these things
are not so, why do they invent for us a mode of 11110011-
neoted connection, the truth being neglected ’.Ρ whereas it
would be fitting that they should say that the Word of (1οᾶ
the Father was united to our humanity, for thus in His
own flesh is He conceived to have suffered What belongs to
man, but so far as pertains to the Nature of the Godhead,
He is free from all that disturbs, as God.

And that 1157 speaking of reference Π, which Ι know not
how thoy invented, they withdraw Emmanuel from His
Glory ancl make Him barely 0110 of the ProphetS, and set
Him amid the measure of the many, and are full surely
caught thus doing, I will prove, giving examples from the
Divine Scripture.
