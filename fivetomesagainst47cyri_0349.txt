those to whom they had dealt kindly‚ He says, In that με ἢῖῑῖἓῖὴ“
did it to one of these least, to Me <lid yc 171. ἓχῇνιζῖῗ·

Lo in these instances is clearly recognized the mode of

reference of what kind it is. The people of Israel were
murmuring against Moses and Aaron and the matter had
reference to Grod, yet were Moses and Aaron men as we.
In the same way too will you conceive as to the others
whereof we have just made mention, yet were some (as I
said before) holy men and worthy of admiration, yet men
as we. Is it then in this way that the man too who is con-
nected (as they call it) with God the Word, will have refe-
rence of his sufferings to Himward‘? And how will he not
now be mere man and apart and nought else? Hence
Emmanuel is not truly God, is not Only-Begotten Son, is
not Grod by Nature.

Why then was no one of the rest honoured by God the
Word with equality of dignity or of sway, but they con-
tend that this man alone obtained all things equal‘? speci-

maketh mention. Why then doth He co-sit Alone? how
will He come as Judge‚ with Angels waiting on Him?
why is He Alone worshipped as well by us as by the spirits
above?

But in good truth it is so (says he), for we find that thou
also dost the same, for thou confessest that He suffered,
in that thou attributest to Him the sufferings of the flesh,
albeit thou keepest Him impassible as God.

But wE, good sirs, (shall I say) having· first united to
the Word the human, have to the fiesh allotted the suffer-
ings, have kept Him impassible as God: for though He
hath become as we, yet are we cognizant of His God-be-
fitting Excellence and of His Supreme Endowments.

Hence first putting the Union as a basis and foundation
to the F aith, we confess that He suffered in the fiesh‚ that
He remained again superior to suffering in that He pos-
sesses Impassibility in His own Nature. But if we are
