pearance as we, and in bondman's form the Lord, foi· thus
do we say that He was MADE FLESH.
Therefore do we affirm that the holy Vir-gin is also

mother of God.

Β. Does it like you that arraying their words against
yours we make a subtler scrutiny of the conceptionS, or
shall we yield it simply to your· word that the matter has

been well apprehended?

A. Irreprehensible as I deem is all that will be said by
ns, wisely and skilfully and not repugnant to the God-in-

spir-ed ScriptureS.

But say, yourself too, what seems good

to you: for a oounter-plea9 will beget something profit-

able.

c Although (as said above p. 24 note
q) Andrew's chief objection to S. Cyril’s
first chapter lay in misunderstanding
S. Cyril‘s term, “ She hath borne after
the flesh‚'‘ applied to the second Gene-
ration, viz. the temporal one, of Gon
the SoN, still he very briefly touches
on, what was Theodoret's main objec-
tion, the n'sk of Apolinarianism. An-
drew closes his objection with these
words, “ Besides, if we apply ourselves
to the words without examination, we
shall be imagining both a change of the
Word and a passing into fiesh, and thus
we shall suppose that He has been
made both sin and ‹sm-se, except we give
heed to what precedes and follows and
to the usage ofthe Scripture. Moreover
that the Word was made flesh, we shall
duly take of the tabernacling 111 flesh,
according to the sense of the Gospels.'’

S. Cyril replies, “ Seeing that, on the
Evangeh'st saying‚ The Word was made
flesh‚ they say that they are afraid lest,

ing, they say that the Word was so made
396311, as He may be said to be made
curse and sin. How ought they not,
being men of sense, to have seen, that
the blessed Evangelist having put, Was
made, removes all suspicion of any
change, by subjoining immediately, And
tabernaeled in us ?

“ In another way too it is absurd to
venture to say, that the Word was so
nwade flesh, as He is said to have been
made curse and sin (for He has not
been made curse's very self, nor yet sin),
but being Righteous He was reclconed
among the transgressors, in order to
bring sin to nought: and He Who bless-
eth the creation has been called a curse,
in order to undo our curse and rid from
sentence them that believe on Him.
Hence He has not been made osa truth
curse and sin but has been called 5ο, to
bring to nought curse and sin.

‘⁴ Hence if He have thus been made
flesh, He hath brought to nought the

the word was made retaining its proper flesh, just as He hath curse and siu, and
meaning, some change be conceived of hath neither been made man nor been
as taking place regarding the Divine in truth incarnate: but in mere 56111-

Nature of the Word3 I applaud their
sear, but marvel that drawing aside the
word and its true and necessary mean-

blance is the mystery and in bare names
is the plan of the Incarnation seen.''
