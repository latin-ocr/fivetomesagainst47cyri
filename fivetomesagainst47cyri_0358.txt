244 His the Boczy, His too all that is its.

A. And verily as in saying that He wAs MADE a curse and
sin, so this that He wAs MADE fleslz introduces with it and has
in its horizon 1 the conception 01 what follows thereupon.

B. How say you? for when one says of Him, He that
knows not sin has BEEN MADE sin for us, and has bought
from the curse of the law also them who were under the
law, MADE for their sakes a curse, how should one doubt
that this is in the times wherein the Only-Begotten was
Incarnate and MADE man?

A. It introduces therefore with the mention of the In-
carnation the things too that on account thereof are eco-
nomically brought upon Him Who underwent the voluntary
emptying, as are hunger and weariness. For as He would
not have been wearied Whose is all might, neither would
He have been said to hunger, Himself the Food and life
of all, had He not made His own the body whose nature
it is to hunger and be weary d: so neither would He ever
have been numbered among transgressors (for thus do
we say that He WAs MADE sin ⁰), He would not have been
MADE a curse, enduring the cross for our sakes, had He
not been MADE fiesh, 1. 0., been Incarnate and made man,
enduring generation like 01115 111 human wise, that I mean
through the holy Virgin.

Β. Ι assent, for you deem aright.

e Elsewhere S. Cyril sayS, “ For
Christ was made sor 115 εἰη, 35 it is
written. And surely not guilty of 5111
(for we are not wont so to wander in
mind) seeing that He had no knowledge
of transgression, being God by Nature
and beaming forth ofGod the Father.
But because He has been made a sacri-
fiee sor 5111 (for Christ om· Passover was
sacrific-edfor us), therefore do we say that
He was made sin alSO.” Glaph. 349 c.
And in connnenting upon Hosea iv. 8,
They eal the sin of My peoplffi S. Cyril
says, ‘⁶ A kid therefore of the goats was
wont to be sacrificed for sin, wheresore
the sacrifice itself was also called sin.'’
in xii Proph. 71 b. But the two expla-
nations of being made sin may be but
two aspects of what the Holy Ghost tells
us in these words.

S. Athanasius sayS, “ For as by re-

infirm Himself, though not Himself in-
firm, for He is the Power of God: and
He became sinfor us and α curse, though
not having sinned Himself but because
He Hiniself bare our sins and our curse,
so &c.⁷’ Agst Arians, ii. 55 fin. p. 359 ¹
Ο.Τ. Similar] S. Cyril, ‘⁶ As therefore
He is said to 113νο been infirm though
not infirm (sor He is the Power of God),
because Ile bare our infirmities, and the
Divine Scripture says that He has been
made a curse, not meaning that He has
been actual] transmade into a curse,
but that He are the curse for 115, and

again He is said to have been made sin,

not as forgetful of His own Nature nor ,

passing into sin Who knew it not, but

because He toolc οη Him our sins, as it is

written, in His body on the Tree, so”
