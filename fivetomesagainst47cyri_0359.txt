Made fleshzborn: else all is loss. 245

A. Itis without understanding in other respects too to think ιε OM:
and to say that the Word was in such sort MADE fiesh as
He WAs MADE a curse and sin.

B. What way do you mean?

A. Was He not accursed that He might undo the curse and
did not the Father make Him sin that He might end sin?

Β. Τ11115 (10 they too say.

A. Therefore if it is tr ue, as it is understood by them to
mean rightly, that the Word 1105 10 511011 sort been MADEs see avebo e,
flesh, as He has been MADE both 011150 and sium i. e. to the ηοω c.
destruction of the flesh 3 how will He render it incorrupti-
ble 0οᾶ indestructible, as having achieved this in His own
Flesh first? for He did not leave it to remain moi-tal and.
under decay, Adam transmitting to us the punishment
for the 131·005ἓ,’1 0551011, but 1·013110105 the fiesh of the uncor-
iuptible God‚ Own 0οᾶ His⁰,1endered it supeiior 130 death 21’1'521
0οᾶ 130 decay. Ξέυτυῡ

Β. You say well.

A. The 5001οᾶ Sor-iptme somewhere says, that 1]ιο first icor. xv v.
man, i. e. Adam, wAs MADE (1 l 11 ἰ119 seul, Hiin that was after, 45
i. e. Christ, (1 911ῐεῖεεηίη9 spirit. Do we then say that as
for the destruction of curse and sin He was MADE curse and
sin, 50 that for the overthrow of being (1 1101119 goul was He
MADE (1 quiekem'wq spirit? for they twisting into what is in-
congruens the force of MADE, say that He was in 511011 wise
= MADE flesh, 05 He was made both curse and sin. We must
therefore take away the Incarnation, or being made man,
of the Word. Which when it is received as a verity, gone
is 13110 whole plan of the Mystery 5 neither was Christ born,
nor died, 1101 miscel, accordinq to 1710 Scriptares.YVhe1e1b 4
therefore 15 13110 Faith, the wer <Z of saith 10111071 100 preciclc. 9 Rom x.
for how did (1οᾶ raise Him from the dead except He also8
died? how died He except He was born after the fiesh. Ρ
'where too is the living again of the dead, bringing in for

oeen raised? where too the quickening of our· human
{¹⁴ odies, which is wrought by the participation of His holy
