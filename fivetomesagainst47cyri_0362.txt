B. Quite 80.

A. Consider in another way too that it is both unhallowed
and discordant to attempt to take away from God the Word
His Birth of woman according to the fiesh ε for how will
His Body quicken except it be His Who is Life? how does
the Blood of Jesus cleanse us from all sin, if it is that of a
common man and one who is under sin ? how did God the
Father send H is Son, mado of a woman, iliade under the law?
how condemned He sin in the fleslz? for it pertains not to

mained what He was, i. e. above and out of Heaven and
(above all as God even with flesh. For thus somewhere
says the Divine John of Him, He that comem from above is
above all. For He hath‘remained Lord of all even when 3
