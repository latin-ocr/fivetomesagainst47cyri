250 Conoeived of the HOLY Grflosrr that we 11119111 be

and admirable and truly marvellous birth and life: and
Himself first became born of the Holy Ghost, Ι mean as to
the fiesh, in order that, the grace passing through as by
a path unto ourselves too, we having not from blood 1101·

from the will of 1110 flesh horsi-om 1110 will of mem but from

God through the Spirit our souls' 7 new birth and spiritual
conformation unto the SON Who is by Nature and truly,
might 0311 God Father and might thus abide undecaying,
as possessing no longer the first father, Adam, in whom we
deoayed. And verily Christ said, at one time, And call
110 one your father 011 the earth,for 0119 is your Father which
is iu Hectven, at another, for that He therefore deseended
111 our estate in order that He might bring us to His own
God-befitting dignity, I (1111 (soiius 1⁴0 My Father (mid your
Fatlaer ancl M⁷gs God ancl your God. For His Father by Na-
ture iis He Who is in Heaven, om· God, but since He that
is SON by Nature and truly has ΒΕΕΝ MADE as we, He says
that He has had Him as His God, after the manner that
is which beseems the emptying, and has given His own
Father to us too 3 for it 15 written, Bm} 05 1113113] as received

10111011 believe 011 His Name. But if we in our unlearning
take away from being MADE in birth 35 we the Word from
out God the Father, Him who 111 all thinqs hctth the pre-
ominence, as the most wise Paul saith; after whom shall
wE any more formed, be called begotten of God through
the Spirit? whom shall we take 35 3 first-fruit for 115 111
this, or who at all will bring the Dignity unto us ?

B. They too will say, I suppose, The Inoarnate Word.

A. How will this be true, except He have BEEN MADE fiesh,

ἰ “ Η9 gives to the nature of man what Thus, we are men by nature, He has-
is His, permitting it to 0311 God Father: tening down for His love's sake into
Himself taketh the properties of the what is beside Nature was made man:
human nature calling the Father His God's bondmen by nature we as things
God. Yet neither do wa deny our bon- made, He too is called bondman, borne
dage that is by nature when we call God unto what is beside Nature when He was
Father nor will the SON lose His Natu- made man. Yea and on the other hand,
ral Dignity by likening Himself to us He Gon by Essence, we too gods
for our good.’' Thes. cap. 15 p 160 e. mounting up unto what is beside nature
“Commixing therefore in a way and for grace's sake (for we are me11): He
commingling usin Himself and Himself SoN by Nature, we too sons by adoption
again in us, Himselfdescendsiuto what called unto brotherhood with Him.’'
