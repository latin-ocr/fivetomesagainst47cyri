i. e. man, making the human body His own by a union 1s ONE
which may not be plucked asunder, in order that it may
be conceived of as His and not anyoue's else? for thus
will He send 1111130 115 too the grace of the sonship and WE
100 shall be born of the Spirit, in that 111 Η1111 first the
nature of man attained this. And the Divine Paul appears
to me, thinking over with himself something of this sort,
10 have said full rightly, For as we bare the 110090 of 1110 1 Cor. xv.

in upon us as from 11ιο 01111115 0110, Adam, the curse, decay,
through which the law of sin too entered in, which is in the
members of our fiesh: but we have been MADE heavenlgs,
receiving this in Christ. For He being God by Nature aud

in an unwonted and strange way, ΜΑυΕ offspring of the

the body united to Him has been rationally ensouled: for
the Word being God, would not, letting alone that which
