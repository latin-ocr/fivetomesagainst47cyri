258 We worship JESUS, a mem {f Gon be not made man.

Jesus, cmcl believe in thy beart that Gozl raised Him fm‘m the
dead, thou skalt be saved.

How then is the mystery of piety any longer great and
famous and in supremest admiration, if we are to believe
that (as the perverted ones say) a man taken and connected

⁵ ἔτι· by way of accident5 to God the Word, died and lived

again: and he was borne up into Heaven, yet is it I sup-
pose to some past belief, if not being by Nature and truly
God, he delights him in the seat of Godhead, the Son by
Nature haply thrust forth therefrom: and there stand in
ministering position Angels ancl Archangels and the Sera-
phim who are hig-her yet, before—not Him Who is in
truth Son and God but before—a man who is rich in name
of sonship by participation and importation ⁶ and in fashion
as we and who has been vouclgsafed the so God-befitting
honour? sor in no wise do our opponents blush at saying
this too. Is not their dogma replete with the uttermost
impiety and blasphemy‘? for that which is given and

κεκ 1- brought 111 7 may be lost, and that which is imported from

without, has the loss of it not inconceivable. I pass over
the further blasphemy and incongruity.

Why then do they drag down the choiceness of the
Economy unto what is uncomely, and make our Divine and
most holy worship, 0 man-worship and nothing else, tak-
ing it from Him Who is in truth Son ancl persuading· 113

whom they say also sped above all ναῖε and authority ancl
[οφ-(137111), imposing· the blame of having been deceived, not
only on them on earth but also on the very rational pow-
ers above, if with us they worship, not the by Nature and
truly Son and the Word which beamed forth of the Es-
sence of God the Father, Incarnate, but as other than He,
