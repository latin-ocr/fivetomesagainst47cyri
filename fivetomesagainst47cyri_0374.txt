that which is of unequal nature with It and with It is wor-
shipped and partaketh of equal glory with It?

- Β. They say that the reference⁵ must be taken in some

such manner as this: viewing God the Word inseverably
connected to him of the seed of David we worship him as
God.

A. Suffices it then in order to his duly taking the glory
that befits Grod and to his being borne above the measures
of creation, that he should be only connected with Him, and
will this render him that is not God an object of worship?
Yet I find one saying to God through the Psalmist's lyre,
My seul is first joined ¹¹ after Thee : blessed Paul too writes,
Hc that is fast joinedss 10 Hm Lord sis 0720 spirit. Shall we
then (tell me) worship those too in reference7 to God as
having been fast jOined8 to Him? Yet the word fast-

cance than the word 00222200t0‹11‚if it be true to say that
what is fast-joined to any has its connection most straitx.

Β. It seems so.

A. Why now dropping 10110719, though a word in wonted
use amongst us, yea rather that has come down to us from
the holy Fathers, do they call it connection3? though the
term union by no means confounds them whereof it is said,
but rather shews the concurrence into one of the things
conceived of as united : and not (full surely) will that which
is simple and of one kind be alone said to be Oney, but
those too which are compounded out of two or more and
out of diverse kinds. For 50 they think to be right who
are skilled in these matters.

Most mischievously therefore do they, severing into two
the One and by Nature and Truly SoN Incarnate and made
Man, reject the Union and call it connection, which any one

v ού- 0150 too may have with God, being almost tied4 to Him by
virtue and holiness, according to that which is by one of ¹

the Prophets rightly said to them who fall back into care-
