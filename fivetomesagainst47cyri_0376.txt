Jer. ix. 1.

262 The FREE ‘made as we, made us as He :

Β. How do you mean?

A. Will (bell me) 131161] which is by nature bond be said
nob incongruously to take bondmau's form, or 111611 which
is bruly free and is Essenbially above the mee-sures of bon-
dage ?

B. The free Ι suppose: for how will i‘fi be made whab it,
was by nature?

A. Consider then ‘ahab bhe Only-Begotben Word of God
albeib made as we and having entered on the measures of
bondage according to the human nature, hassh wibnessed
to Himself freedom by Nature, saying in His joint-contri-
1161166Ζ of the didrachma, Surcly free arc the sons. He
receives therefore bondman’s form, making His own the re-
66116 of the emptyinga and nob spurning the likeness to
usward: for ib were nob possible otherwise ‘co honour the
bond unless thais which beficteth the bond had been made
His that it: might be made illustrious by the glory that is
from Him ε for thass which excellcbh ever 1161511 the pre-emi-
nence and the 6116616 from our bondage was wiped 6111] 1157
us. For He Who is above us has been made as we and the
Free by Nabure was in the measure of the servanbs. Hence
the dignity hath passed unto us too : for WE too have
been called 6666 of God and inscribed 66 oui· Father Him
Who is properly His Fabher ,· for our human things have
been made His also.

Therefore in saying that He book bondman' 6 form, is 1116
whole mys’oery of the Economy wibh fiesh. Eub if confess-
ing One Son and Lord, the Word from forth of God the
Father, they say that a man, him who is forth of the seed
of David has been simply connecbed with Him, a partaker
of His Sonship and of His ἓ(1161·57, time is it 111611 we in
