2642 ONE in mode wholly passiny zcw'zdersbandivq ε

suppose that either the Divine Nature of the Word has
been turned into what it was not, or that the flesh went
over by way of change into the Nature of the Word
Himself (for it is impossible)? but we say that One is the
SON and One His N atune even though He be conceived of
99 having assumed flesh with 9 rational soul. For His (99
Ι said) 1191311 the human nature been made, ancl He is con-
ceived of by 119 110119 otherwise than thus, Gon alike 91111
111911.

Β. There will then be not two natures, of God and of
man ‘?

A. Godhead ancl manhood 91·9 0119 thing 91111 another, 90-
cording to the mode [of being] existing in each, yet 111
Ohr'ist 119179 they come together, in unwonted wise and.
passing understanding, unto 11111011, without confusion and
turningb. But wholly incomprehensible is the mode of
the Union.

Β. Ancl how out of two thing-S, Godhead and 111911110011,
will One Christ be conceived of?

A. In 110 other wise (I suppose) than that whereby the
things brought together 0119 to another· unto 9 11111011 111-
dissoluble and above comprehension will be One.

B. As for example?

A. Do we not say that a 111911 like 119 19 One and his 119-
ture one, although he 1199 not simpleness [of nature] but 19
compounded out of two, I mean soul and body?

Β. We do.

A. Does anybody‚ taking anew the flesh apart by itself,
91111 sundering from it the soul that· was united to it, divide
9 single person into two ancl not thereby destroy the right
description of him?

Β. Yet the all-wise Paul writes, Foo· even thouqh om· out-
ward mem perish yet is the inwcord renewecl each clay.

A. You said right: for 119 knew, he knew well from
whence he is 0119, ancl makes 13119 distinction [between the
two] one to be grasped in idea only ε 119 99119 the soul, the
1ἰηῑωακνίῐ maoz, and the flesh, the camard. For I call to mind
