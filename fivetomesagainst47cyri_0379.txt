⁸ The fear felt by the Easterns that
One Nature Incarnate must necessarily
involve the [Apollinarian] marture, be-
ing stated in full here and also by Suc-
census in his hypomnesticon, S. Cyril
replies carefully both here and in his se-
cond letter to Sucoensus, see further on.
In his first Letter to Succensus, he says,
“ There is therefore One Son, One Lord
Jesus Christ, both before the Incarna-
tion and after the Incarnatiou: sor not
One Son was the VVord out of God the
Father, another again he who is forth of
the holy Virgin, but Himself Who was
before the ages is believed to have been
born according to the flesh too of a wo-
man, not as though His Godhead took
a beginning of being, or was called unto
beginning of existence through the holy
Virgin ; but rather that (as 1 said) being
WVord before the ages He is said to
have been born of her because of the

For His is His flesh, just as of each
one of us his body 15 1115 own. But

haply ye are pleased to fancy and say
that a confusion or cominixture or eom-

same Succensus, puttiug down first the
objection which Suecensus had sent
him, ,‚ lf there is one Incarnate Nature
of the VVord, needs must one say that
there is comniingling and commixture,

pervert right things know not that there
is in truth One Incarnate Nature of the
