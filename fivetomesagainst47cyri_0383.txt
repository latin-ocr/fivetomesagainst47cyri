A. They will therefore sever into two sons, and both of

them will be proved to be falsely so called, and I think one

may say that the mystery of Christ is idle trickery 7 if it is ⁷ εἷκαῖον
thus as our opponents foolishly say, WVhere then is the νακαιῖτῖἶξῖι
Union and in regard to what do they say that it has been
wrought‘? or haply this that the Word was made fiesh is

found to be untrue and to have been superfluously brought

in, if the Word from forth God the Father have not been

called son of David by reason of His being made from

forth his seed after the flesh. But Ι think that they ought

wise Paul, to no one of the angels hath the Father at any

time said, My Son art THou, nor yet, Sit on My Right
Hand. How then is he who is forth of a woman in su-
premest dignity and 011 the seat of the Godhead and be-
