as we has 11015 been changed, the Spirit-clad has shewn ιε om:
saying, Jesus Christ yesterclay (md z‘o-clay, tlte Same 100 sor lb.
ever. And yesterclay indicates pasb time, io-dey present)

bime, for ever ebat which is future and to come.

But if they think that] they have thoughb out something
elever, in taking yesc‘erday ancl to-clay to mean recenb, as-
serting and saying, He that] is yesterday and 'co-day how

will he be also for ever, WE too will transfer the force of the
’ question unto the direct> opposite: The Word which is for
ever how will He take to Himself Yesterday and izo-day,
if Chrisss is One and has not been divz'ded, as says the Divino 1 Cor. i.
Paul? For thab thus He would be known by ns, you will 13.
know hence also. For· albhough seen 111 13110 1510511 and hav-

besbified to Himself His Ε1ῑο1Ἵ11114 Being saying, Verz'ly I Sffohn

come down from heaven, and bhen 1110 Same appearing man
as we 3 as One Chrisb and Lord even when He was made ⁸
flesh, does He say bhese things.

Β. Another argument] too has been discovered by them,
ib is this : they say that] he which is of the seed of David
ought so 110 100 called son of God as ‘che Word Which is forth
of God the Fabher is said bo be son of David: for neither
is so by nature t.

A. Now leb bhe mode of 'che brue Union come in, ‘uhab so
11110 Word be believed to have been made flesh, i. 0. man,
and therefore son of David 11011 falsely bub as from forth
him according 'co the flesh, having remained too what He
waS, i. e. God out of God. And verily the priesbs of the
gospel preachings, knowing· that the Same is Grod alike
and man, have told us of Him. It 15 written of the blessed

Baptista that, On 1110 111011·οω he seeth Jesus coming] ΐο him ancl ἐξ iii-1
