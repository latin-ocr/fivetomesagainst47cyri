malae Om- Abocle with him. Yet the Father has never been
called man, nor yet has the Holy Ghost, by reason of in-
dwelling in us : but those men laugh at the Mystery of the
Incarnation and twist round unto what is discordant, the
doctrines of the Church which are so right and worthy of
being heard.

But let our argument prooeed again on its course, bid-
ding farewell to their vomit. For if, because of the lVord
being in him, he have been made a worker of signs, they
perchance say that he is one of the holy Prophets, for [the
VVord] has Wrought Divine signs through the hands of the
saints too: but if they say that the Son is in these, they
lower Him into the measure of Prophets or Apostles,

B. Yea, they say, for has He not been called Prophet 2
and Apostle‘?

A. You are not wrong.- for Moses said to them of the
3 raoe of Israel, A Ρ1 0217161 shall 1116 [101ίῖ 902 m Gocl waise up ξὲεξξέξι·

B. Yes.

A. Yet they would say that to Christ 111 that He 15 con-
ceived of as God these things are petty and not worthy of
receiving, even though through these very things He is
seen emptied and receiving them with the manhood. But
as being God by Natme and Lord m ti uth‚ He took bond-
man’ s form, made therein and assuming our estate, so, both
giving the Spirit of Propheoy and orclaining Apostles and »you
establishing Priests,1 He was made like m all thingls to His Ib.i1i.17.
' brethren : for thus was He named, Prophet‚ Apostle, High

Priest.
