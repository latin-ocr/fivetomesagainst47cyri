that He have been made flesh according to the Scriptures:
but since we rest firmly on this, and the doubting one whit Ἴ
about it involves a charge of impiety, come let us view
closely, as far as we may, the depth of the economy.

The &Vord therefore from forth of God the Father ap-
peared in likeness of DS, to aid in countless ways our human '2 Α
condition and to shew full well the path that leads us to ·
everything that is admirable. It was then necessary that
we should learn, when temptation attacks them who are in
peril for the love of God, what sort of people they ought
to be who have chosen to live a life and conversation noble ,
and excellent 3 whether they should be seen by their Sa-
viour remiss and falling back into negligence and out of
due season revelling and spreading themselves out for de-
light z or intent unto prayer and bathed in tears and thirst-
ing for aid from Him and for manliness 5, if He should be
pleased that we should also suffer. It needed besides what
we should know to our profit, whither the goal of obedience
ends and through what prizes it goeS, what and how great
the reward of endurance. Christ therefore became a pat-
tern of such things, and hereto the divine Peter confirms
us saying, For what revzown zj'svz'nw'vzg] aoid bwqffeted ye 011-
dure? but ‘f well-doing] με muliere, this is fltsmzslafmm God,
because Oloris& 1‘00 died for us, leswinss 2⁶8¹ usn ensample that
ye should follow His steps. Hence the Word of Grod no
longer bare ¹¹¹ and imparticipate in the measures of the emp-
tying but rin the days of H is flesso has been made a pattern
to us; in that then without any blame He could use the
measures of the human nature and prolong His prayer

and shed the tear ¹¹ and seem now both to need a Saviour and

scend a little and take account of the
measure of the human natule. For the
Imp ress of the Father would not have
died; but since the supplication has been
made in the days qt His flesh, the sear
will be that of the 110511 and th⁷e dread of
death of the human nature in 1150111181

receive the Name which z's aboze eteris

the bounds of Godhead in that He is
