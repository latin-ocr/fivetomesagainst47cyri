Gal. i. 1.

lb. 11,12.

296 The lucarnam SON makes His even the daily gyrowth ;

eharging His own flesh to proeeed by the paths of its own
nature ς and it belongs to human nature to advanee in
stature and wisdom, 1 may say in grace also, in that the
understanding too that is in eaeh springs upward eonjointly ,
With the measures of the body : for it is one in babes, other ³
again in those that are now children and upwards. For
it were not impossible or impraetieable to the Word from
forth of the Father as God, to rear on high even from the
very swaddling-elothes the body whieh was united to Him
and to bring it up to the measure of perfect stature 3 Ι will
say 1300 that to shew forth admirable wisdom even in His Ἴ
baby-state would have been both easy and without ob-
stacle5 to Him, yet would it have savoured of wonder-
working and been incongruens to the plan of the Eeonomy 3
for the Mystery was performed noiselessly. He permitted
therefore eeonomieally the measures of human nature to
prevail in His own case, for this too will have been arranged
in the meet order of the likeness to usward, whose advanee
is by little and little to what is greater, as the season calls
us to accession of stature and of understanding not out of
harmony therewith.

All· Pei-feet therefore, and un-laeking of ought whatever,
and too of increase, is the Word from forth the Father
as God z yet makes He His own what is ours seeing He has
been made as we: yet we know that He 10 even so above
110 as Grod. And verily Paul dares, albeit knowing that
He has been made flesh, looking at the Excellenees of
the Godhead, in places to say that He is not even man:
he writes to them of Galatia, Paul aaz apostle notfrom men
11ον ἐ7ιῡόιιῃή man beot throufsh Jesus Christ, and elsewhere
too, I declam to you the Gospel which was yospelled by
‘me that it is not after mem, for neither did I receive it from
man nor was I tauyht ἰή, but throuqh revelation of Jesus
Christ.

Β. We must therefore ada-pt to Him both the being said

to progress in wisdom and stature and grace, just as [we j
do] the hungering and being weary and the like: and q
perhaps even if He be said to suffer and to have been ·
