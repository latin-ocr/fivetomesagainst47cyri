Β. Ῡο11 think aright, but they maintain that these'things ,

who was connected with Him in equal honour, to undergo
the oontumelies of the Jews and the sufferings on the cross,
yea and death itself and that he became the captain of our

salvation, in the might of the Word Who was co-with him ¹

coming back to life and doing to nought the power of
death.
