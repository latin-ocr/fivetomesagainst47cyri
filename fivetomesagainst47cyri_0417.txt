The SoN suffers cmc? does 1101 suffer. 303

Divine Peter too says that Clu-ist once for om· sins died for 1s Om:
113, the Rigshz‘eous for the unrz'gsszteous, in order that He misslzt ilii.SizI3‚.et'
bring] us 10 Geel, put 10 death ‘in tlte ι110871, quielcened ¹in the
Spirit. For why, might one I suppose say, did the Spirit-
clad say not simply or indefinitely that He suffered, but
added, in the fles-lc? for 110 knew, he knew that of Grod
was he speaking. Therefore he hath allotted to Him im-
passibility in that He is conceived of as God, most skilfully
adding, in tlzefleshff, in respect to which suffering exists.

B. Yet they say that it savours of the marvellous 2 and
inclines much 130 the incredible‚ that we should have to say
that the Same both suffers and does not sufferg. For either
surely He hath as God not suffered or if He is said to have
suffered, how will He be God ’.Ρ hence he who suffered will
be said to be only he which is from forth the seed 01 David.

A. Yet how will it not be a most manifest proof of a
feeble understanding, to choose so to say and to think?
for God the Father hath given for us, 11013 a common man,
taken aside to be in the rank of a mediator, and having a
made-up 3 glory 01 sonship and honoured with an acciden- ³ κατά-

tal4 connection, but, made in likeness with us for our sakes, Ϊὲζςζῖπῗέῇ

all things most absurd, when the Only-Begotten has been
made flesh according to the Scriptures (as I said) and dis-
dained not the Economy, to find fault as it were with above PP-

Him as though He had militated against His own glory ξ13ἓῖῧῖ 2223)-

and had chosen to suffer in the flesh apart from what was
fit. Yet, good sir, the matter was salvation 130 the whole
world: and since He for this cause willed to suffer Who

is beyond the power of suffering because He is God by gggve p.
