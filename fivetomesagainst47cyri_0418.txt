was glor-iens in another way: for the Resurrection has
testified that He is superior 10 death and deoay, being Life

speaking there on the words, For the

albeit He is immortal in His Nature,

the flesh hath not come down 0111011163-

but in countless expressions He is seen
gathering both into One and mingling

the words, He that came down from

He was before (ib. vi. (52), although the
human nature came not down from
Heaven‚ nor was it there before. To-

S. Cyril speaks of S. John, “all-but ga-
