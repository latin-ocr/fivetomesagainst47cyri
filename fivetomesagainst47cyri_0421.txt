The FATHER gave His Son, some clengs it. Impassible. 307

Divine dogmas as a sort of full armour I will rear up 1110 15 ONn
truth against them who think perverse things.
For that the Only-Begotten WVord of God, no other son

than He mediating the Economy and connected with Him
accidentally, hath made void the mastery of death3 but
