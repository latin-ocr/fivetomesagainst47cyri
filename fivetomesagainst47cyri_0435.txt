Cyril’s work these few fragments that

survive seem almost entirely due to the
ζ Monophysite Controversy in the first
’, half ot'the sixth century. The fragments
, are mainly preserved either by Severus
of Antioch (chiefly in his work against
John Grammaticus of Caesarea, but
also in other works) and by John of
Caesarea himself who appended a vast
number of extracts of S. Cyril to his
Apology for the Council of Chalcedon.
Anastasius, referred to by the learned
Cave, under Severus (Viae dux cap. 6
pp. 90, 92, ed. Ingolstadt‚ 1606 says of
this John, “Then John of aesarea

defences for the synod (of Chalcedon)
through truest extracts . . . Severus
having looked into the compilations of
the Caesarean and some others who
compiled in behalfof the synod through
very many extracts of Fathers and wri-
ters and demonstrations and proofs, first
of all straightway wrote against John of
Caesarea.” Further on, Severus ⁴⁶ laid
down as a law to them [in Syria Egypt
Alexandria and elsewhere] in the same
book which is called Philalethes‚ that the
Faith of Chalcedon frittered away 230
itations of hol Fathers in the defence
hich John of aesarea made in its be-
alf.” ib. p.96. In the MSS of John’s
efence which have supplied many of
hese passages against Diodore and
heodore, they are numbered 181—196.

Defence of the Council of Chalcedon is
extant in MS. in syriac (as Cardinal
Mai tells us, in Cod. Vat. 140 written in
the eighth Century), and in Greek in a
late manuscript at Venice and at Cairo.

Of the character of Diodore's writings
the learned Tillemont who appears
most marvellously to have made himself
acquainted with every extant writing of
eve Father, says “We cannot be judges
of t is great difficulty [whether Dio-
dore’s writings were heretical] because
we no longer have his writings which
would need to be examined with great
care, not stopping at cnlled passageS.’'
t. 8. 568 ed. 2. S. Cyril however who
had access to them says of him, “One
Diodore, being once as they say, an op-
ponent of the Smmr, communicated
with the Church of the Orthodox. This
man having put off, as he deemed, the
spot of the Macedonian heresy, fell into
another infirmity. For he deemed and
wrote that one son by himself is he who
is of the seed of David, born of the holy
Virgin ; another Son again by Himself
the Word out of God the Father. But
veiling the wolf under the sheep’s fleece,
he pretends to say One Christ, allotting
the Name to the Word alone begotten
out of God the Father, the Only-Be-
gotten Son : and allotting itin the cate-
gory of a grace, as himself says, he
styles him too of the seed of David son,
as united (he says) to the in truth Son:
united, not as WE hold, but only as re-
gards dignsty, sway and equalit of ho-
nour. His disciple Nestorius ecame,
and darkened by Diodore‘s books,
feigns'' &c. Ep. 1 to Succensus 135 d e.
Tillem ont thinks that what S. Cyril says
of Diodore having been a Macedonian,
is not to be pressed. t. 8. 566.
