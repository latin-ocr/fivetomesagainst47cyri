m. AG. those which do harm 3 and that WE who have understand-
ing and right reason (for nature is wise and has perfectly
the power of well examining each thing) should not rightly
and without error exa-mine the force of things written or
spoken that we may honour with praise the things which
are blameless, and turn aside from all which are unduly
spoken and which step outside of the doctrines of the truth.

Albeit how ought not one who wanted to shew the dif-
¹ ἲδιωμά- ference of the proper-ties ¹, I mean of flesh and Godhead‚ to
advance to this very point by such thoughts and words as
were meet ? For not the same as regards the quality which
is inherent in each of the things named, are Body and the
Unembodied, the flesh taken of human lump and the Word 1
which beamed forth from the Essence of God the Father.

Yet we must not therefore sever into two christs and sons »

Let Diodore hear now from us too, If you say that H

ἅνθρω- is flesh whom you call a Nazarene or an assumed man2
ληφθέντα shew thyself to us apart from al] disguise and mask, tel 1
(Ι pray) clearly what you deem good to think, and do not

simply speaking of flesh without soul, attempt to carr γ

away the hearers. Since WE ourselves say that accordin ῃ

³ ῖδιότη- to the plan of proper nature 3, the flesh will surely be o
⁷⁰³ other nature than the Word which sprang out of God th Ι
Father, yet hath it become His by Union which may no Ἴ

⁴ ἆδιά- be plucked asunder 4.
