But haply you will say, ,Hath not then in Him develli all
, ἐὴθῂιῖηθεθ of the Godhead bodily .? ‚ This too is true and one
will not deny what has been written3 yet we say that not
in another’ 5 body do we conceive that the Godhead of the
SoN hath dwelt‚ but rather as in His own Temple: just as
the soul of man too, being other than ¹³ the flesh yet together
With the flesh makes up the person of a single man, as
Peter or Paul.

Yet Christ is conceived of as above this too : for we say
that not the Word of God became to the body ’111 place of a
50111, as some most absurdly imagine ⁰ 3 but we affirm rather

b κατὰ 5661115 an error for πα ὰ.

⁰ The Apollinarians: see in Ti lemont‚
above p. 44 note col. 1. The extracts
from S. Athanasius, speak of the Apol-
linarian unwillingness to own that our
Lord made His own ought of created
matter3 see the theory that the body was
consubstantial with the Godhead, their
refusal to worship ought created, to allow
that Christ was man. Diodore and The-
odore having all this to battle with speak
as if, while holding that the manhood is
perfect and complete, they disjoined it
altogether from God the Son, making
it a distinct man and calling it His in
some vague way without uniting God-
head and manhood in one. Calling it
His in some vague way hindered their
seeing that they were really dividing
Christ into Two being& God and man,
separate from each other. Theodoret
notwithstanding the powerful influence
of these two minds, and his dread of
Apollinarianism, enunciates clearly the
Union, though with language occasion-
ally vague. Andrew's statements (of
Samosata in the same province) are still
more clear. S. Athanasius says, ‘⁶ But
ye say again, ‚We do not worship a
creature„ O void of iuiderstanding!
why do ye not consider that, made the
Lord's Body, it bears away no created
worship? for it has been made the
Body of the Uncreated Word: Him
Whose Body it has been made, to Him
do ye offer the worship also.⁷' against

Apollinarius, lib. i. 6. t. i. 926 c. ‘⁴ For
ye essay to say that the flesh is con-
substantial with the Godhead.'' ib. i.
9 t. i. 929 b. “But ye say again, ‚If
‚ Christ be man, He will be a part of
,the world, and a palt of the world
‚ cannot save the world„ O thought of
deceit and madness of blasphemy, let
them say of what Scripture is this rule
or sophism of the devil : albeit the Pro-
phet saith ...... Ami α Μαη was born
in lzer and the Higlzest Himselffounded
her. How then does Christ not save the
world, made man? seeing that it is
manifest that in the nature wherein sin
was committed, therein hath had place
the abumlanee of grace. What is abun-
[lance of grace? That the Word hath
been made man, abiding God; in order
that made man too, He may be believed
to be God, so that Chn'st being man is
God, because being God He has been
made man, and in human form saves
the believers.” lib. ii. 7 t. i. 945 b c d.
“How then do ye say that the Word,
Creator of the rational natures, coni-
mingling with Himself flesh, was made
a rational man? and how without
change and turn hath He been made
man, if He did not compact the bond-
man’sform 5ο as to be rational? in or- ἶ
(161· that the Word may be without turn,
abiding what He was, and being God
may be seen on earth, man endowed
with reason : for the Lord is a heavenly
