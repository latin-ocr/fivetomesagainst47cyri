„ created, had ‘ohe Word for his God, and when created
,‚ he became of God the Word: for wibh us first a temple
„is prepared, and then He Who dwellebh enters it3 in 'ohe
„ womb of the Virgin He Who dwellebh fashioned Him-
„ self a Temple and removed nob from the Temple bun filled
‚, 111 with His glory and His Wisdom: nor as in the case
,‚ of the Prophets, was ‘chere ignoranoe with Him unbil the
‚, Spirit made revelation„

and again he cites him saying the opposite, after this wise,

⁷„ For the Godhead did nob immediately on his creabion
,‚ or birth, infuse all His Wisdom within him, bun by little
„ and litffle gave ib 150 ‘che body. ‚,

against these things therefore, forthwith did he who wisely exposed them,
add,

the contrary 3 for he affirms that the Goclhead of the Son

did nob as soon as he was born, put all His wisdom within
him, albeib he wrote in what] is a little above [Diodorus cited
by Cyril] „ For wibh us firsb bub filled it wibh His glory
,‚ and. His wisdom „ (as above).
