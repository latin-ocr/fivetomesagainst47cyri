⁸ Theodore, the contemporary and, in
early days, comrade of S. Chrysostom,
brother of Polychronius, Bishop of Apa-
mea, was for about 36 years Bishop of
Mopsuestia in Cilicia: he djed in 428.
John Archbishop of Antioch and Theo-
doret were therefore at the opening of
their Episcopate when Theodore was
now in old age. He seems to have been
of a gifted family, for Theodoret closes
his history (lib. v. 39) with the praise
of Polychronius for grace in speech
as well as in nobility of life. And Theo-
dore too was a Preacher and writer,
of great repnte in the Province of An-
tioch. But he seems to have lacked
stability and a well-balanced mind. and
thus his controversy in earlier life a-
gainst the Arians and Apollinarians led
him, as well as Diodore whose pupil he
was, to speak of the Incarnation as
though it were only a condescension of
God the Son in connecting with Himself
in some way a man who had an already
distinct Being. In the next Century,
Facundus Bishop of Hermaeum near
Carthage who endeavours most strenu-
ously to defend Theodore, has preserved
along extract of Theodore⁷s from a work
called, ‘Of Apollinarius and his heresy‚²
in which Theodore sayS, ‚‚ Thirty years
„ago Ι wrote a book of 15000 lines on
,‚ the Incarnation of our Lord in which
,‚ I examined the faults of Arius and
,‚ Eunomius hereon and also the empty
,‚ presumption of Apollinarius‚ through

,‚ ventured to take up the gauntlet against
„the book . . . they wrote certain silly
„things which Ι never said and foisted
„them into my book and shewed them
„to their friends, sometimes too to our
‚‚ people who of their over-easiness lis-
„tened eagerly to it all, and offered it
‚‚ as a proof as they imagined of my
‚, wickedness. And one of these writings
„was to say two sons„ (Theodore in
Facundus‚Def. iii. Capp. X. 1, Gallandi
Bibl. Vett. Patr. xi. 770, 771). Never-
theless howevermueh Theodore attempts
to shield himself under cover of interpo-
lations, his assertion (see below pp. 347,
355) of One Son and explanation of how
he means One convict him of that heresy
which John of Antioch‚ Theodoret and
others, though they valued and admired
Theodore, escaped.
