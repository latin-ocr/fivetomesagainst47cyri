Col. i. 18.

CHRIsT erst Gon only, now, Gon and Man .· hath reneweol us.

He was commanding the Apostles this, distinguish His
proper Godhead from His visible body, nor when He af-
firmed that He was Christ did He distinguish Himself from
soul and fiesh, being thus both God and man, bondman
visible and Lord acknowledged, veiling the height of His
Godhead with the low estate of the Incarnation, lifting

up the low estate of the visible body by the operation of

from the Godhead but we declare Him One and the Same,
erst not man but God and Son only and before the ages,
unmingled 1 with body and what belong to body, at the end
Man too assumed for our salvation, suffering in flesh, Im-
passible in Godhead‚ circumscribed in body, uncircum-

and conceived of, contained in space and boundless, in

which was subject to death, in order that manifesting it
superior to both death and decay, He might transmit the
grace to us too. For as in Adam we were brought down
unto death, so in Christ thrusting aside the tyranny of
death, are we re-formed unto immortality.
