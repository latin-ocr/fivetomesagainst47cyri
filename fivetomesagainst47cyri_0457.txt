Holy aad baaleth. 343

0110 who is believed to be in part holy is thought to be in rammi.
another part infirm. Besides what is that defeot which (as

the opponent asserts) the Holy Ghost supplied, 11131 the

other part too might be perfect and might break the devil's

onset? Yea and not only is He Holy and verily most
perfect but also endued with full power· who used to heal
sorrows and every sort of infirmity.

1) This and the following extracts are
from the collection prepared for the fifth
Genera] Council, and read in its fifth
collation. It was in preparation for this
Council that Facundus Bishop of Her-
maeum (quoted above p. 337) had writ-
ten his work, and no doubt John of Cae-
sarea's vast array of extracts were pre-
pared for the same purpose.

‘1 Thus far is given by Leontius of
Byzantium as Diodore’s. After a nuni-
ber of extracts of Theodore, Leontius
gives five, which he attributes to Dio-
dore with the title, lee same Diodore ont
of Boolc 1 α ainst the Synousz'asts. This
is the fourt of them. (Against Nesto-
rians and Eutychians Book 3 in Gallandi,
xii. 697.) Leontius' translation is a dif-
ferent 0110 110111 11131 cited before the
fifth Council. Gallandi assigns to Leon-
tius the date about A.D. 610, nearly 60
years later than the Council. The 111111
Council and Leontius agree in citing the
work on (or 35 Leontius calls it, against)

the Incarnatiom in fifteen books, δι 1110
four books against Apollinarius (Leon-
11115,οοοΚ3111)1511Ρ13Ρρ.695,696; Conc-
vi. 43 &c). The Council further cites
yet another treatise: lee same from the
bools against the Synousiasts or Apolli-
narists, which blessed Cyril put forth and
answered (ib. 54, see below p. 345 and
note s: so Pope Pelagius Il in his Letter
to Elias of Aquileia and other bishops
in Istria. Cone. vi. 269). Leontius does
not (as far as I see) cite this last, but is
it a part of the treatise whence Leontius
does cite five pieces as Diodore out ofhoolc
1 against the Synousiasts ‚⁹ of these five,
the first is by Mercator too (p, 350 Bal.)
attributed to Diodore (Mercator does
not mention what book he exn-acted it
from), the second is at p. 347, the third
at p. 344, the fourth here, a piece of the
fifth is by S. Cyril (p. 333) attributed to
Diodore, while he attributes 2, 3, 4 to

Theodore.
