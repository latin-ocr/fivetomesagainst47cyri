Scriptura? says so .· Ληρεῖς and we worship. 349

,how would He have suffered ‘?‚ But wn, wise sir, are THEOD.1.
wont to glorify God the Father because He completesl a,

Boclgs for the Son : and we say that the Son Himself truly

made flesh‚ i.e. man, suffered indeed emptying for our

sakes, and underwent the low estate of our poverty, yet
remained even thus God and Very Son of God the Father.

How then did He not please to be called son of David if

He were made man and that not against His will?

From the first Book of Cyril of holy memory that Christ is One against
Theodora.

For there are, there are who deny their Redeemer and
Lord and say that He is not true Son of Grod the Father
Who in the last times of the age endured for our sakes birth
of a woman after the fiesh 3 but rather that a new and late
god appeared to the earth, having the glory of sonship
acquired from without just like us and boasting as it were
in honours not his own, so that it is just man-worship and
nothing else, and some man is worshipped together with
the Holy TRINITY by us and by the holy angels. These
things indeed they, exoeeding haughty and much-wise in
the knowledge of the Divine Scriptures have inserted in
their writings‚ and as the Lord of all says through one of
the holy Prophets, He set a snare to corrupt men. For Jer.v. 26.
what else than a snare and a stumblfflg-block, is a tongue
uttering perverse things and counter to the sacred Serip-
tures and shamelessly resisting the Tradition of the Holy
Apostles and Evangelists‘? We must therefore repudiate
them who are obnoxious to such evil charges whether they
are among the living or not : for from that which injures
it is necessary to withdraw, and not to look to person but
to what pleases God.
