S. Cyril in his second Book against Theodore of Mopsuestia,

But I ‘think 11161 this, viz, 11161 of Christ alone 1116 Saviour
of all is 11 said by 1116 God-inspired Scripbnre 11161 He was
born in 1116 fiesh, shews 11161 being God He was made in
0111· likeness. I mean somebhing of 11116 sort: For no one
receives one who would say either of 1116 all-wise Moses,
01· of one of 1116 Saints 11161 116 was born in 1116 flesh of 1116
Jews, or of a woman : for no one has any 011161· birth, for of
flesh is flesh mother. But if Christ be said 10 bein 1116 flesh
of 1116 JeWS, i. e., of a woman, 1116 addition of in tlzeflesh has
some wise meaning and replete with declarations of things
necessary for 1116 hearers. For in order 11161 we may 1101
suppose 11161 1116 Nature of 1116 Word, 11161 is, His Godhead,
had a beginning of being 11161 11 was in 1116 flesh and of
flesh, 1116 phrase in the flesh must be taken cautionsly and
in 116 necessary meaning. For being God by Namare, and
Ver-y Son of Grod 1116 Father, He was made in likeness of
men and made His own 1116 fiesh which was of 1116 holy
Virgin.

for he wrote thus in his second book against Theodoro,

But I would fain ask him what] he says 11161 uniby of comp. p.
Person is. For if he says 11161 1116 Only-Begotten God 1116 355.
Word Incarnabe is One SoN, One will be 1116 Person of 1116
SON : 10111 if he altogether disbinguish and say 11161 One is
said 10 be and is Son in 1111111, and one by grace, and 10
1116 0116 gives 1116 glory and 1116 appellation of Godhead
and 1116 bare name alone of sonship : but 10 1116 other 11161
116 receives 11 as from Another and a Superior, and One
so exalbed and in Excellency, as is God above man, what:
room will 111616 be for unity of person, a thing 11161 Ι know
1101 how 11 is put forth by him?
