GOD made-man. :355

„in the rank of sonship with the rest the man that was mamm.
„ assumed not for that he partakes of sonship in like man-
„ ner as they, but in regard that he assumed in like man-
„ner the grace of sonship, the Godhead alone possessing
„ sonship by Nature θ. For it is certain that the glory of
,, sonship is in him speeially beyond others on account of
„the Unity that he has with Him. Whenoe in the very
„word too that means Son, he too is in like manner in-
„ cluded. But theyf argue with us, If ye say two things
‚, perfect, we shall surely be also saying Two sons. But lo
„he is called son too by himself in the divine Scripture,
„ without the Godhead, co-numbered with the rest of men,
„ and we do not say Two sons. But One Son there rightly
„is in our confession, ‘seeing that division of natures must
„ needs remain and union of person be kept indissoluble.

to be worshipped as God by every creature, himself shall
come 111 as witness. For numbering Him with those who
are sons by grace and the multitude of men, he argues that
the Godhead of the Word has alone the glory of true son-
ship, all but finding fault With Him Who for our sakes
was pleased to suffer emptying ε 01 haply even casting his

own base madness on the disciple who says, ΑΜΖ the Word issl'llffhn
