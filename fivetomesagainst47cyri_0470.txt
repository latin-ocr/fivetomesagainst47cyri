ruam. was made flesh. We must know therefore that although
he somewhere says one and not rather two sons, casting
out altogether him who (as he says) is of the seed of David
from being (1οᾶ and Son, he refers the glory of true son-
ship to only Grod the Word Who is forth of (1οᾶ the Father.
This is nought else (as I said) than not to take on Him the
measure of human nature, but utterly to destroy the Eco-
nomy whereby we were both saved and have passed from
death and sin and have laid down the yoke of the devil's
oppression.

Theodore from the same book.

,‚ Let none be deceived by the craft of the questionings.
Heb. xii. „ For it were a wicked thing to put down so 9νοαέ αι crowd
,, os witnesses (as the Apostle said) and, deceived by cunning
,, questioningS, to ι10111 the side of the opponents. But what
„are the questions which they artfully ask? ‘Is Mary
„mother of man or God’s mother ‘?' and, ‘ Is He Who was
,‚crucified, God or man?' But of that there has been a
„ clear solution in these things which we have said before
„in the replies which were made to the questions: never-
„theless let that be said even now which one ought to
„briefiy reply in order that no occasion be left them for
„ their cunning. When g therefore they ask, ‘Is Mary
„mother of man or God's mother? let answer be made
„ them, Both3 one from the nature of the thing, the other
„ by reference. For she is mother of man by nature, be-
„ cause he was man in the womb of Mary, who also pro-
,, 00οἇοἃ 1110110οε 11111 mother of God because (1οᾶ was in
„ the man who was born, 1101 circumscribed within him by
,‚ Nature, but in him in the affection of the will. Hence
„it is right to reply, Both, 11111 not in like wise. For not
,,35 man took in the womb a beginning of his being, did
„God the Word too, for He was before every creature.
,, Hence it is right that both be said, each according to their

„pl oper notion.
