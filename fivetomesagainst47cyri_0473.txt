does he say that He was made holy and not rather that He Tflnonfl.
was so? For in that He is said to be made 50, it is quite
necessary to understand that He was not what He was
made. But if He were holy always, and was not so made

in time, how does he say that the SPIRIT soared down upon

Him and shewed that He was worthy of 13110 connection and
added to Him what He lacked‘? For this too he has put ’

in his 0131101· books. For what was it that was at all lacking

130 Him unto sanctification from the very womb, yea rather see above,
and before Birth aster the flesh, 10 Him who is hoiy anci ΡΜ
spotless and sanctifieth the creature? When therefore he

says that J esus would not have been counted worthy of
connection with God the Word except He had first been
rendered spotless, he is indicting very many accusations
against his empty talk. For first of all he unbecomingly

sayS, been comzted wortlzy .· next he severs into another son

apart Him Who 15 forth of the seed of David, whom 110
shamelessly maintains is called JESUS apart by Himself.
Further‚ 130 say that He was made spotless, as if at one time

He were not so, this 1300 has very great blasphemy. For

God 13110 Word united from 13110 very womb 130 His own flesh

was One Son and thus also spotZe-s’s, 13110 Holy of holies, and
giving of His fulness the SPIRIT 11013 only 130 men but also S· John
to the rational powers above and in Heaven. ι’ 16.
