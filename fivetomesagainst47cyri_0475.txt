From the second book of Cyril Bishop of Alexandria that One is Christ
against Theodore.

That the ungodly Nestorius desired to follow the cloc-
trines of Theodore, does not aequit him, rather it will thence
work a deeper charge against him. For when he might
have taken hold of the right words and spotless discourses
of the holy Fathers on the Godhead, he thinks fit to prefer
a lie to the truth. For he let alone what was theirs, he
chose rather to cleave to what was base and to delight him
in such perverted words. That this man therefore who
hath such aim and madness, should have leapt down here-
