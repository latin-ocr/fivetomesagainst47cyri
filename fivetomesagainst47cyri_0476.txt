these books or writings which we mentioned above of the
man spoken of, have been found certain things full of the
uttermost impiety, how would it be oongruous to choose to
be silent? for he severs the inseverable Christ and, in
place of One Son, he honours a duality falling away from
truth and as it were tinted with false names. For he says
that God the Word Who is forth of God the Father was
called man, yet not that He was so made in truth: the
man, Him who is of Mary (as 116 speaks) whom too he in

many places cleverly calls flesh1‚ he says was called 111-

some laid stress on the word ‘ good Theo-

in order that the context might shew if
it were so: after the recital, “ the holy
Synod said, ‘The things recited shew
that Cyril of religious memory blaming

above mentioned Facundus (book iii.

au thor ofthe work [against Diodore and
Theodore] treats os a section in which
the Apostle says to the Hebrews‚ For not
