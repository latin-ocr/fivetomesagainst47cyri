FROM HIS TREATISE RAGAJNST THE Si‘NO USl.·1-5·Ts’·

of which the beginning is

A long discourse has already been made by us,

⁸ The opening fragment of this Trea-
tise has been preserved to us by the fifth
General Council, those that follow by
John Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine,
in his Defence of the Council of Chal-
cedon, of the two last fragments, the
former is in Severus’ treatise against
John, the latter in a later collection.
Bishop John heads his citations from
S. Cyril: “ Divers citations of Cyril
Archbisho of Alexandria wherein one
may find t e djfference of the Two Na-
tures proclaimed by him and that God
the Word is Impassible and Immortal,
the Temple passible and mortal.'’ The
ms. containing Bishop J ohn’s fifteen ci-
tations from this treatise numbers them,
77—90 (91 is a passage from the Gla-
hyra), while the citations from the 3
iiooks against Diodore and Theodore are
numbered 181—196. This led to these
fragments being placed first in the edi-
tion of S. Cyril’s works, following the
order of Bishop J ohn's citations. But
the present treatise is not purely against
the Synousiasts or Apollinarians, though
it cites their objections, in something of
the same way as S . Athanasius does z but

ror, of Diodore and Theodore; see the
commeneement and the l'7th fragment,
cited by Severus and the words with which
Severus introduces it, below p. 376. See
too above p. 335 fragment 2¹7 against
Diodore‚ which may really belong to this
book, not to that. Ι have then no doubt
that the present treatise is the one on the
Incarnation which Liberatus refers to.
He sayS‚ ‘⁵ Cyril as reports go, wrote 4
books, three against Diodore and Theo-
dore as authors of Nestorian dogma and
another book on the Incarnation, where-
in are contained genuine testimonies of
old Famem, i.e., Felix Pope of Rome,
Dionysius Bishop of Corinth and the
marvellous Gregory called the Wonder-
worker. And though in the Books the
words of Theodore against the Arians

¹ are cited yet they maintain that he was

Nestorius' master.” Liberatus, Brevi=
arium, cap. x. in Gallandi xii. 134«. The
opening paragraph of this Treatise‚ ‘⁴ A
long discourse has already been made
&c''‚ shews that it was written after the
books against Diodore and Theodore.

b S. Athanasius, after having spent all
his life in combats and suflerings for the
Truth against Arianism, had, in the
close of his days, to oppose the mad er-
rors of the Apollinarians or Synousiasts.
Their chief errors are stated thus by
S. Athanasius in the opening of his first
book against Apollinarius; “ but these
either fancy a change of the VVord or
suppose that the Economy of the Pas-
sion is a semblance3 one while saying
that the flesh of Christ is Uncreate and.
heavenly, other while, that it is consub-
stantial with the Godhead . Next they say
that in place of the man that is within in
ourselves qi. e. the inner man] there was
an heaven y mind in Christ3 for He used
as an instrument the form which enve-
lopes Him, for it was impossible that He
should be Perfect man: for where per-
fect man is, there too is sin, also that two
perfects cannot make one whole.'⁷ A-
gainst Apollinarius lib. i. ξ 2. t. i. 923.
See extracts of his two books against
them, above p.324 note e. S. Athana-
sius exposes the chief points of their
misbelief more succinetly in his famous
Letter to Epictetus, Bishop of Corinth.
S. Gregory of Nazianzum, the contem-
porary of S. Athanasius had to contend
with them in his very midst (see Tille-
mont’s life of him, Art. 88 t. 9. pp. 515
sqq. ed. 2) and as Tillemont points out,
to bear their accusation that he divided
into Two the One Son (“ Next they ac-
cuse me as though 1 introduced two na-
tures separated or opposed, and divided
the Super-natural and marvellous U-
nion, when I ought either not to do what
they accuse me of, or not to accuse them
of what they do,’' second Letter to Cle-
donius, near the end, t. i. 749 ed. 1609).
Under these circumstances S.Gregory
both opposes the Apollinarians, and ex-
