A ⁰ LONG exposition has already been wrought out by us,
who desire to strive for the doctrines of the truth. For
it everywhere sets forth One Lord J esus Christ, Who pro-
ceeded forth God the Word out of God the Father Divinely‚
out of a woman humanly and after the fiesh. And let no
one say, who has a mind witting how to view each several
thing, that Ι have been borne savagely down on them who
have not such saith , seeing that a sort of sorrow sometimes
invites hereto, sorrow I mean in regard to them whom we
have contradicted. For the fact itself has its proof d,
not an idle excuse. For they1 indeed are already dead
and departing from human affairs„ have gone to another
life, and it is utter folly in enmity to insult nob the living

ever we are to call it. Ι say ‘ one thing

presses himself with that accuracy on
and other ' in contrast to how it is in the

the Incarnation that his words are cited

before the Council of Ephesus as 0011-
tradicting Nestorius‘ teaching. He says,
“ Ifany suppose that Mary is not mother
of God, he is external to the Godhead.
If any say that He passed through the
Virgin as through a channel, and not
that H e has been formed in her Divinely
alike and humanly, Divinely because
without a man, humanly because by the
law of bringing forth, he likewise is god-
less. If any say that the man was
formed, that God then entered Him he
is condemned; for no Generation of God
would this be, but a shunning of birth.
If any introduce two 5005, 0118 Η1111 who
is out of God the Father, the other him
who is forth of his mother and not One
and the same, may he fall away from
the sonship which is promised to them
that believe aright. [This will illustrate
the strenuous efforts which Diodore
Theodore and Nestorius made to per-
suade themselves that they were not
really saying two sons.] For two natures
are God and man, as also sonl and body,
not two sons nor two gods. For neither
are there with us two men, even though
Paul so spoke of the inner part of man
and the outward. And to s eak briefly,
one thing and other (ἄλλο μεν καὶ ἄλλο)
are that whereos the Saviour is, seeing
that the invisible is not the same as the
visible, and the apart from time with the
subject to time, not one and other (ἄλλος
δὲ καὶ ἄλλος), not so3 for Both are One
in commixture (ἓν τῇ συγκράσει), God
made-man, man-made-God‚ or how-

TRINITY: for there it is One and Other
(ἄλλος καὶ ἄλλος) that we confound not
the Persons, it is not one thing and other
(ἄλλο δὲ καὶ ἄλλο), for in the Godhead
the Three are One and the same Thing.''
