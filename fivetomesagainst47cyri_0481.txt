And as it has been believed to be impossible that the
Nature of the Word should change into what it was not, so
can it not be that the generate pass into the nature of God-
head, lest many of Its attributes be seen to be accidents‚
which if it advanced so far as idea alone would have the
charge of blasphemy indelible. For if ought of things

The Lord being God appeared to us that He might destroy

exhibit His own Nature partaker with decay by imming-
ling with Himself flesh subject to death.

The charge therefore is of equa] force, whether one say
that the Word of God have been turned into the nature of

consubstantiality with God. It 13 fit therefore that we keep
