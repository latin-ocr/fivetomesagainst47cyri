That we may believe that even though His holy and all-
pure Body be of same nature7 with our bodies, 11 18 never-
theless august and Divine and far above our measures, as
having been made His own, for He hath wrought through

it, therefore was it called also bread of sze, yea verily it is
01¹1 said both to have come doum from Heaven and to give life

to the world because of the Word that came down from
above and out of Heaven, whose very own too the flesh has
been made. Hence Divine it 18 (as Ι said), yet may one
not 8111111180 if indeed he have a mind well-established and
that is versed in skill of dogma, that it has changed into
the nature of 1110 Godhead. For to the Nature that is Su-
preme and above all must be rigidly preserved Simplicity
and absence of blending with other and of any appearance
of being compounded in what belongs to It or of lacking
any addition and coming into fellowship of sameness of
nature or consubstantiality with ought unconnatural to It.
For come let us with acute eye of 1110 understanding 111-
vestigate 1110 idea of the confuserS. They say that His
Flesh has been changed (I know 1101 how) 11110 consubstan-
tiality with God 1110 Word. Why ⁴? or what is it that brings
it thereto? For of its own self 11 has 1101 1110 impulse that
would bring it theretO, and of 118 natural motions 10 admit
such desires 18 foreign 10 it. It remains then to say this,
that it was brought hereto by 1110 will of God the Word.
Did He 111011 cast away the Economy which He clearly
deemed worthy of all account by reason of His inherent
Clemency and the Pleasure of His Father‘? for one may
hear Him say clearly through the psalmist’ s voice, Sacr'fflce
111ῑᾶ qfferivy Thou woulclest not, whole burm-offerirzys cmdfor
εἰη Thou deliqhz‘edst not in, but α Body Thou perfeetedst lise,

oin-iiten of Me) to ds), O God, Thy Will: I deliqht to clo it.
