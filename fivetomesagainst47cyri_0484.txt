xv.17.

370 olm-ist not a Mediator unless both God and Man,

the Flesh and the confession of our saving Faith will (it
seems) come to an end together, and with it surely 063561
‚the justification too that is through it, we [1νο yet 2'72 our
81718, the filth of our old offences is still not cast away.

6

If He have ceased from being as we, 1.6. man, together
with being also above 115 Divinely‚ the foundation of our
salvation has been shaken, we unawares returned (it seems)
to have to be again lorded over by death and sins. For
as when the nethermost foundations of house (it may be) or
wall have been shaken, the superincumbent parts 100 will
surely subside with them z thus if the Economy with flesh
of the Only-Begotten be not firm, our condition surely
has tottered with it and grown weak at last 3 and how, we
will say. For if they say that the Flesh of the VVordsshave
been changed into the Nature of the Godhead, there is
every 116611 to conceive that He has otherwise departed
from His will to be son of man ι then how cloes the all-wise

n .ii. Paul say, For there ‘is 0110 God, 0ηο Mediator 1⁴00 of (11οεί comt

men, the Mam Cho-ist Jesus tho qave Himself a ransom for
us? For He mediates as being the Same, Gocl alike 31111
Man, reconciling us to God the Father through Himself

is tlte Man Christ Jesus conceived 10 be 31111 15 our Media-

tor. But if the Flesh has been really (as he says> cast away
by Him, He is gone surely away from mediating between
us and His own Father: how therefore 110 we yet approach
Him? who any longer brings us or mediates? For the
Divine Paul said that the Mediator is Man: we remember

n Christ also Himself saying‚ No mem cometlc to the Fczz‘lzer

distraction3 are the inventions of the Synousiasts.
