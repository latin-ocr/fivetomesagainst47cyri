The, Flesh and the Word not comminqlecl. 373

ye decide to retain to the Nature of the Word Its un-
changeable Being and unalterable Existence (for in no
wise will it change unto what it was not) : either when it
has suffered this It has been shaken from Its God-befit-
ting stability and from the settledness that is inherent in
