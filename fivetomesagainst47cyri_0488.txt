374 By ‘ after the flesh' S. Paul means

m. Ac.. though we say that He let Himself down to emptiness and

{elac->ve entered into the likeness usward, not in order that Him-
self might be seen suffering somewhat in His own Nature,
but that He might render us who are in flesh and blood
superior to fiesh and might make 115, beyond the measures
of human nature, sons of God.

But if as the perverted ones say He have been com·
mingled with fiesh‚ borne aside unto what ΗΘ was not,
how they say that ΗΘ has not been wronged Ι cannot
conceive g 3 haply ΗΘ is found to have lost in addition, the

Heb. i. 3. very being the Form of the Father, the Likeness and Im-
press of His Person and to be no longer in equality with
Him but rather in a depression and abasement of both Na-

ture and glory.

It were therefore nothing hard to add very many dis-
cordant things to what have been said 3 but I think that
one ought gladly to withdraw from thoughts tending to
absurdity. We must therefore eschew commixtum, for
thus shall we escape the mischiefs too that come thence.
But some other argument (as they say) as to these things
finds its way in. For the Divine Paul is found to have

2Cor. v. written, But ‘f we haue also known Christ after the flesh

16. yet now πο more do we know Him. Hence if ye know not

Christ after the flesh (they say), one must needs say that

the flesh changes, so that it is the Nature of the Word
Himself : as God is He known ¹¹.

But Ι suppose one would say straightway to this, ‘When

Rom viii ‚therefore he says of us too, But they which ave in the flesh

8, 9. ,cannot please God, but ΥΕ eme not ‘ln the flesh but m the
